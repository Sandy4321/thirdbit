                <p>
  By now, many people in the UK (well, many of the sort who read this blog)
  will have heard the term Research Software Engineer,
  but what exactly is an RSE,
  and what effect will the creation of this title have?
  To understand, we need to go back to
  the <a href="http://software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a>'s
  <a href="http://software.ac.uk/cw12">Collaborations Workshop</a> in early 2012
  (summarized in <a href="http://dirkgorissen.com/2012/03/26/the-researcher-programmer-a-new-species/">these</a>
  <a href="http://software.ac.uk/blog/2012-04-23-work-scientific-software-engineers-recognised-academia">blog</a>
  <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2012-11-09-craftsperson-and-scholar">posts</a> and others).
  Those discussions led to
  <a href="http://digital-research-2012.oerc.ox.ac.uk/papers/the-research-software-engineer/view">this position paper</a>
  at <a href="http://digital-research-2012.oerc.ox.ac.uk/">Digital Research 2012</a>,
  whose authors argued that:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Research institutions need individuals with a new professional
    designation&mdash;the <em>research software engineer</em>. These
    individuals combine a professional attitude to the exercise of
    software engineering with a deep understanding of research
    topics. They lead the design and construction of increasingly
    complex research software systems, and play an important part in
    the co-design of research requirements, understanding and
    addressing software engineering questions that arise in research
    planning.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The importance of recognizing this role is hard to understand if
  you've never worked inside a large system, and hard to overstate if
  you have. Far too many of the people who build the complex software
  that scientists rely on live from one grant to the next, and
  constantly have to re-explain to the new chair or dean what exactly
  they do. They are as important to research as the people who design
  orbiting telescopes and electron microscopes, but because software
  is intangible, they are rarely recognized in the same way.
</p>
<p>
  We can't afford this any longer: as demand for their skills outside
  academia keeps growing, it is becoming harder each year to retain
  the people without whom modern science would grind to a halt. And
  while naming and recognizing their career path won't magically make
  stable funding appear, it will certainly help.
</p>
<p>
  The campaign to get the RSE role recognized quickly gathered steam.
  Simon Hettrick led work on the topic for
  the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability
  Institute</a>, which resulted
  in <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/save-your-work-give-software-engineers-a-career-track/2006431.article">coverage</a>
  in the Times Higher Educational Supplement in the summer of 2013,
  and brought together a group of leading RSEs who ultimately set up
  the UK RSE Association. The concept of a national organisation was
  first discussed at the fringes of the 2013 Digital Research meeting,
  was tested on the community at a workshop in 2013 and started life
  proper in 2014 with the first Annual General Meeting of
  a <a href="http://www.rse.ac.uk">UK Association for RSEs</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This group lobbied the key players at the UK research councils,
  where people like Susan Morrell and her team embedded a call into
  the UK's ARCHER national HPC infrastructure proposal and the EPSRC's
  "Software for the Future" calls. At a recent research
  councils' "future of e-infrastructure" meeting it was
  clear that the whole community now recognises that funding software
  is at least as important as hardware, and EPSRC recently announced
  <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/rsefellowships/">a call for an RSE fellowship program</a>
  to help people found RSE groups.
</p>
<p>
  Many Software Carpentry instructors are RSEs,
  even if they're not yet called that.
  As the term and the role become more widely accepted in the UK,
  we hope that the idea will also catch on elsewhere
  so that people who devote themselves to the kinds of things we teach
  will get the recognition we all need them to get.
  If you'd like to know more,
  please <a href="http://www.rse.ac.uk/join.html">join their mailing list</a>
  and <a href="http://www.rse.ac.uk/help.html">help them grow</a>.
