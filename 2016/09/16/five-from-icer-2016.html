  month, and give a good sense of what CS education researchers are
  looking at and what they're finding.

  "<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2016/icer_2016_bimodal.pdf">Evidence That Computer Science Grades Are Not Bimodal</a>",
  10.1145/2960310.2960312.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      Although it has never been rigourously demonstrated, there is a
      common belief that CS grades are bimodal. We statistically
      analyzed 778 distributions of final course grades from a large
      research university, and found only 5.8% of the distributions
      passed tests of multimodality. We then devised a psychology
      experiment to understand why CS educators believe their grades
      to be bimodal. We showed 53 CS professors a series of histograms
      displaying ambiguous distributions and asked them to categorize
      the distributions. A random half of participants were primed to
      think about the fact that CS grades are commonly thought to be
      bimodal; these participants were more likely to label ambiguous
      distributions as "bimodal". Participants were also more likely
      to label distributions as bimodal if they believed that some
      students are innately predisposed to do better at CS. These
      results suggest that bimodal grades are instructional folklore
      in CS, caused by confirmation bias and instructor beliefs about
      their students.
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This was the most thought-provoking paper of the conference, as it
  shows pretty conclusively that people are seeing evidence for a
  "geek gene" where none exists.  Mark Guzdial has called this belief
  <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/189498-top-10-myths-about-teaching-computer-science/fulltext">the
  biggest myth about teaching computer science</a>; I hope this paper
  will finally put some nails in its coffin.

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      The recent surge in interest in using educational data mining on
      student written programs has led to discoveries about which
      compiler errors students encounter while they are learning how
      to program. However, less attention has been paid to the actual
      code that students produce. In this paper, we investigate
      programming data by using learning curve analysis to determine
      which programming elements students struggle with the most when
      learning in Python. Our analysis extends the traditional use of
      learning curve analysis to include less structured data, and
      also reveals new possibilities for when to teach students new
      programming concepts. One particular discovery is that while we
      find evidence of student learning in some cases (for example, in
      function definitions and comparisons), there are other
      programming elements which do not demonstrate typical
      learning. In those cases, we discuss how further changes to the
      model could affect both demonstrated learning and our
      understanding of the different concepts that students learn.
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The authors present "â€¦a preliminary exploration of the application
  of knowledge-based learning curve analysis on programming data with
  the goal of extending the promise of educational data mining to
  programming."  Doing this requires them to identify knowledge
  components, figure out how to measure progress toward correctness,
  and a host of other details.  Their discussion of how they
  operationalized these issues was the most valuable part of the paper
  for me, since it allowed me to see very clearly what their
  assumptions and definitions are, and where my own thinking is vague,
  fuzzy, or contradictory.  It's intriguing work, and I look forward
  to their next paper.

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      Being able to identify low-performing students early in the term
      may help instructors intervene or differently allocate course
      resources. Prior work in CS1 has demonstrated that clicker
      correctness in Peer Instruction courses correlates with exam
      outcomes and, separately, that machine learning models can be
      built based on early-term programming assessments. This work
      aims to combine the best elements of each of these
      approaches. We offer a methodology for creating models, based on
      in-class clicker questions, to predict cross-term student
      performance. In as early as week 3 in a 12-week CS1 course, this
      model is capable of correctly predicting students as being in
      danger of failing, or not, for 70% of the students, with only
      17% of students misclassified as not at-risk when
      at-risk. Additional measures to ensure more broad applicability
      of the methodology, along with possible limitations, are
      explored.
    </em>

</blockquote>

<p>
  There's no point getting people into computer science classes if
  they then drop out.  Here, a group from several different
  institutions show how to build a statistical model that uses clicker
  data collected during the course of peer instruction to identify
  students who are likely to drop out only three weeks into an
  introductory course (i.e., early enough to intervene).  Crucially,
  they conclude that, "Should an instructor not use Peer
  Instructionâ€¦simply asking the same multiple-choice questions before
  or after class could produce similarly accurate results."  While I
  remain nervous about
  <a href="http://third-bit.com/2014/03/14/learning-at-scale.html">widespread
  monitoring students in classrooms</a>, it's clear in this case that
  doing so could help a lot of people we might otherwise lose.

  10.1145/2960310.2960314.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      Parsons problems are an increasingly popular method for helping
      inexperienced programmers improve their programming skills. In
      Parsons problems, learners are given a set of programming
      statements that they must assemble into the correct
      order. Parsons problems commonly use distractors, extra
      statements that are not part of the solution. Yet, little is
      known about the effect distractors have on a learner's ability
      to acquire new programming skills. We present a study comparing
      the effectiveness of learning programming from Parsons problems
      with and without distractors. The results suggest that
      distractors decrease learning efficiency. We found that
      distractor participants showed no difference in transfer task
      performance compared to those without distractors. However, the
      distractors increased learners cognitive load, decreased their
      success at completing Parsons problems by 26%, and increased
      learners' time on task by 14%.
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A Parsons Problem is a programming challenge in which the learner is
  given the statements they need to solve a problem, but in a jumbled
  order.  They must then put those statements together to get the
  right answer.  I've been using them for about a year in the classes
  I teach, and finding them really useful.
</p>

<p>
  We know from prior work that high school students who completed
  partially written programs later constructed better quality programs
  than students who authored programs from scratch Here, the authors
  explored what happens to learning when Parsons problems include
  distractors of various kinds.  Crucially, they found early that
  there was little point including irrelevant and tangential
  distractors, so they focused on distractors that encouraged learners
  to follow familiar but suboptimal solution paths.
</p>

<p>
  Their conclusion is that distractors of this kind in code puzzles
  provide no clear benefit while reducing learning efficiency.  As a
  practicing teacher, this is exactly the kind of result that I look
  for from researchers: a plausible idea has been shown empirically to
  have no educational benefit.  While this single result is not
  revolutionary, the accumulation of such results is what we need to
  build the body of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) that computing
  education needs.

  10.1145/2960310.2960327.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      We investigated implications of transparent mechanisms in the
      context of an introductory object-oriented programming course
      using Python. Here transparent mechanisms are those that reveal
      how the instance object in Python relates to its instance
      data. We asked students to write a new method for a provided
      Python class in an attempt to answer two research questions: 1)
      to what extent do Pythonâ€™s transparent OO mechanisms lead to
      student difficulties? and 2) what are common pitfalls in OO
      programming using Python that instructors should address? Our
      methodology also presented the correct answer to the students
      and solicited their comments on their submission. We conducted a
      content analysis to classify errors in the student
      submissions. We find that most students had difficulty with the
      instance (self) object, either by omitting the parameter in the
      method definition, by failing to use the instance object when
      referencing attributes of the object, or both. Reference errors
      in general were more common than other errors, including
      misplaced returns and indentation errors. These issues may be
      connected to problems with parameter passing and using
      dot-notation, which we argue are prerequisites for OO
      development in Python.
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Python is my favorite programming language, but it does have its
  warts.  One that irritated me when I first switched from C++ and
  Java to Python is the need to include <code>self</code> explicitly
  in method definitions.  I therefore wasn't surprised to see that 53%
  of novices forget to include <code>self</code> in method headers,
  along with other problems associated with the explicit use
  of <code>self</code> to refer to "this" object.  As the authors say:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Even a minor oversight could have learning implications given the
    feedback that the Python interpreter provides. Below is the error
    message students see when they omit the self parameter:
  </p>
  <p><code>TypeError: lookup() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given</code></p>
  <p>
    Because the error message does not mention 'self' or refer to the
    instance object placed before the calling method, students who simply
    forgot the instance object among the parameters may have difficulty
    interpreting this message to correct their omission.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Like the previous paper, this is exactly the kind of practical,
  evidence-based advice I look for as a teacher.  The authors of this
  paper go on to say in a section title "Guidance for Instructors":
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Given these difficulties, instructors are advised to have students
    practice the fundamentals of parameter passing and dot-notation as
    a prerequisite to class definitions. For students to see how
    Python transforms the method call by adding the instance object as
    one of the parameters, student understanding of parameter passing
    needs to be effortless.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  I'll be adjusting my lesson plans accordingly.
