              <div class="post-content">
                <p>My <a href="/blog/archives/4546.html">Who Decides?</a> post has produced some rather heated email. In answer, no, I am <em>not</em> defending the existing university system: I quit my faculty position at the University of Toronto in part because it doesn't serve students well, and doesn't have a future beyond elite networking-building [1]. But the fact that educational reactionaries are wrong doesn't mean that all educational revolutionaries are right; it particularly doesn't mean that the centralizing pseudo-progressives are on the side of the angels.</p>
<p>For example, quite a few people have pointed me at <a href=" http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/">Clay Shirky's recent post</a> comparing Udacity with Napster. In it, Shirky says:</p>
<blockquote>The possibility MOOCs hold out isn't replacement; anything that could replace the traditional college experience would have to work like one, and the institutions best at working like a college are already colleges. The possibility MOOCs hold out is that the educational parts of education can be unbundled. MOOCs expand the audience for education to people ill-served or completely shut out from the current system, in the same way phonographs expanded the audience for symphonies to people who couldn't get to a concert hall, and PCs expanded the users of computing power to people who didn't work in big companies.</blockquote>
OK, I buy that. But in talking about some feedback Udacity got on the awful quality of its statistics course, he says:
<blockquote>Conceding that Delta "points out a number of shortcomings that warrant improvements", Thrun detailed how <em><strong>they</strong></em> were going to update the class. [emphasis added]</blockquote>
<p>Aye, there's the rub. In the Udacity/Coursera/Khan model, "they" are the only ones who can update the learning material, and thereby decide what's to be learned. Where's the hackability? When, where, and how can I fork their course, make changes, and send a merge request? Sure, I can set up my own, but if I have to compete with Harvard's prestige (read: its old boys' network), that's like saying that anyone could set up their own TV network&mdash;in practice, only those with bankrolls like Turner's and Murdoch's can pull it off. (I used to write for <cite>The Independent</cite> in London, and felt very sad when it stopped deserving that name.)</p>
<p>As far as I can see, the pseudo-MOOC model that the <cite>New York Times</cite> and others are gushing about effectively concentrates power in ever-fewer hands. Some of it is indirect&mdash;if 90% of learners get their lessons from six "prestige" schools, a lot of voices will effectively be silenced&mdash;and some of it is <a href="http://hapgood.us/2012/11/09/coursera-praises-mooc-wrapping-as-they-attempt-to-ban-it/">pretty explicit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>You may not take any Online Course offered by Coursera, or use any Letter of Completion as part of any tuition-based or for-credit certification or program for any college, university, or other academic institution without the express written permission from Coursera.</blockquote>
<p>Got that? You can watch <em>their</em> videos, and do <em>their</em> exercises, but you can't even take the badge they give you somewhere else unless they say you can. That's a hell of a lot more restrictive than any policy any old-style university I know of could get away with: there, the receiving institution decides whether or not to accept prior work, and the granting institution has no say in the matter.</p>
<p>A while back (January? February?) somebody in Mozilla's learning team asked whether we should be teaching kids how to re-mix their Facebook pages. I think we should instead teach them how to re-mix the walled-garden LMSes that everyone seems to want to hand their future to.</p>
<p>[1] I predict that within five years, we will see companies offering residential campus life to 18-25's who are getting their education online. They'll provide exam invigilation (so that those digital badges the kids are earning actually mean something), a gym, lab and studio space for sciences and the arts, and most importantly, a chance to socialize. I do <em>not</em> think this is a good future&mdash;in practice, it will set the clock back to 1950, when higher education was the preserve of a privileged few.</p>
