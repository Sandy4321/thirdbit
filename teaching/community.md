# Building Community

<div class="changed" markdown="1">

> **Objectives**
>
> * Learners can make an informed decision about whether to create
>   something new, or join an existing effort.
> * Learners can judge whether a meeting is well organized and well
>   run or not.
> * Learners can outline a three-step plan for recruiting, retaining,
>   and retiring volunteers and other organization participants.
> * Learners can explain the difference between a service board and
>   a governance board, and judge which kind an organization has.

Many well-intentioned people want the world to be a better place, but
don't actually want anything important to change.  A lot of grassroots
efforts to teach programming fall into this category: they want to
teach children and adults how to program so that they can get good
jobs, rather than empower them to change the system that has shut them
(and people like them) out of those jobs in the past.

If you are going to build a community, the first and most important
thing you have to decide is what *you* want: to help people succeed in
the world we have, or to give them a way to make a better one.  If you
choose the latter, you have to accept that one person can only do so
much.  Just as we learn best together, we teach best when we are
teaching with other people, and the best way to achieve that is to
build a community.

## Learn, Then Do

The first step in building a community is to decide if you really need
to, or whether you would be more effective joining an existing
organization.  Thousands of groups are already teaching people tech
skills, from the [4-H Club][4h] and [literacy programs][frontier-college]
to get-into-coding non-profits like [Black Girls Code][bgc].  Joining
an existing group will give you a head start on teaching, an immediate
set of colleagues, and a chance to learn more about how to run things.
The only thing it *won't* give you is the ego gratification and
control that comes from being a founder.

Whether you join an existing group or set up one of your own, you owe
it to yourself and everyone who's going to work with you to find out
what's been done before.  People have been writing about grassroots
organizing for decades; [[Alinsky1989](biblio.html#alinsky-rules)] is
probably the best-known work on the subject, while
[[Brown2007](biblio.html#brown-bpco)] and
[[Midwest2010](biblio.html#midwest-organizing)] are practical manuals
rooted in decades of practice.  If you want to read more deeply,
[[Adams1975](biblio.html#adams-seeds)] is a history of the Highlander
Folk School, whose approach has been emulated by many successful
groups, while [[Spalding2014](biblio.html#spalding-adults)] is a guide
to teaching adults written by someone with deep personal roots in
organizing.

### Meetings, Meetings, Meetings

Knowing how to run a meeting efficiently is *the* core skills of
community organizers. (Knowing how to take part in someone else's
meeting is just as important, but gets far less attentionâ€“as a
colleague once said, everyone offers leadership training, nobody
offers followership training.)  The most important rules for making
meetings efficient are not secret, but are rarely followed:

1.  *Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting.* If the only
    purpose is to share information, have everyone send a brief email
    instead.

2.  *Choose a chair.* A meeting without a chair is going to work just
    about as well as an orchestra without a conductor.

3.  *Write down the agenda, with timings.*  List the items that are
    to be discussed and estimate the time allowed for each.  Your
    first estimates with any new group will be wildly optimistic,
    so revise them upward for subsequent meetings.

4.  *No technology.* Insist that everyone put their phones, tablets,
    and laptops into politeness mode (i.e., closes them).

5.  *Record minutes.*  Someone other than the chair should take
    point-form notes about the most important pieces of information
    that were shared, and about every decision that was made or every
    task that was assigned to someone.

6.  *Make sure the chair doesn't speak more than anyone else.*  The
    chair is there to make sure that the meeting keeps moving, *not*
    to do most of the talking.

7.  *Require politeness.* No one gets to interrupt anyone, no one gets
    to ramble, and if someone goes off topic, it's the chair's job to
    say, "Let's discuss that elsewhere."

8.  *End early.* If your meeting is scheduled for 10:00-11:00, you
    should aim to end at 10:55 to give people time to get where they
    need to go next.

[[Brown2007](biblio.html#brown-bpco)] and
[[Brookfield2016](biblio.html#brookfield-discussion)] have lots of
good advice on running meetings, and if you want to "learn, then do",
an hour of training on chairing meetings is the most effective place
to start.

## Three Steps

> *  Me in 2012: I'm not going to worry about retaining volunteers

Everyone who gets involved with your organization, including you, goes
through three phases: recruitment, retention, and retirement (from the
organization).  You don't need to worry about this cycle when you're
just getting started, but it *is* worth thinking about as soon as you
have more than a couple of non-founders involved.

The first step is recruiting volunteers.  Your [marketing](marketing.html)
should help you with this by making your organization findable, and by
making its mission and its value to volunteers clear to people who
might want to get involved.  Share stories that exemplify the kind of
help you want as well as stories about the people you're helping, and
make it clear that there are many ways to get involved.  (We discuss
this in more detail in the next section.)

Your best source of new recruits is your own classes: "see one, do
one, teach one" has worked well for volunteer organizations for as
long as there have *been* volunteer organizations.  Make sure that
every class or other encounter ends with two sentences explaining how
people can help, and that help is welcome.  People who come to you
this way will know what you do, and will have recent experience of
being on the receiving end of what you offer that they can draw on,
which helps your organization avoid collective
[expert blind spot](gloss.html#expert-blind-spot).

> As [Ben Franklin][franklin-effect] observed, a person who has
> performed a favor for someone is more likely to do another favor for
> that person than they would be if they had received a favor from
> that person.  Asking people to do something small for you is

> opportunity to start a conversation that might lead to a new
> recruit.

Recruiting doesn't end when someone first shows up: if you don't
follow through, people will come out once or twice, then decide that
what you're doing isn't for them and disappear.  Two things you can
do to get newcomers over this initial hump are:

1.  Have them take part in group activities before they do anything on
    their own, both so that they get a sense of how your organization
    does things, and so that they build social ties that will keep
    them involved.

2.  Give newcomers a mentor, and make sure the mentors actually do
    some proactive mentoring.  The most important things a mentor can
    do are make introductions and explain the unwritten rules, so make
    it clear to mentors that these are their primary responsibilities,
    and they are to report back to you every few weeks to tell you
    what they've done.

The second part of the volunteer lifecycle is retention, which is a
large enough topic to deserve its own section.  The third and final
part is retirement.  Sooner or later, everyone moves on (including
you).  When this happens:

1.  Ask people to be explicit about their departure.

2.  Make sure they don't feel embarrassed or ashamed about leaving.

3.  Give them an opportunity to pass on their knowledge.  For example,
    you can ask them to mentor someone for a few weeks as their last
    contribution, or to be interviewed by someone who's staying with
    the organization to collect any stories that are worth re-telling.

4.  Make sure they hand over the keys.  It's awkward to discover six
    months after someone has left that they're the only person who
    knows how to book a playing field for the annual softball game.

5.  Follow up 2-3 months after they leave to see if they have any
    further thoughts about what worked and what didn't while they were
    with you, or any advice to offer that they either didn't think to
    give or were uncomfortable giving on their way out the door.

6.  Thank them, both when they leave and the next time your group
    gets together.

## Retention

The community organizer Saul Alinksy said, "If your people aren't
having a ball doing it, there is something very wrong."  Community
members shouldn't expect to enjoy every moment of their work with your
organization, but if they don't enjoy any of it, they won't stay.

Enjoyment doesn't necessarily mean having an annual party: people may
enjoy cooking, coaching, or just working quietly beside others.  There
are several things every organization should do to ensure that people
are getting something they value out of their work:

1.  *Ask people what they want rather than guessing.*  Just as [you are
    not your learners](lesson.html#a-reminder), you are probably
    different from other members of your organization.  Ask people
    what they want to do, what they're comfortable doing (which may
    not be the same thing), what constraints there are on their time,
    and so on.

1.  *Provide many ways to contribute.* The more ways there are for
    people to help, the more people will be able to help.  Someone who
    doesn't like standing in front of an audience may be able to
    maintain your organization's website or handle its accounts;
    someone who doesn't know how to do anything else may be able to
    proof-read lessons, and so on.  The more kinds of tasks you do
    yourself, the fewer opportunities there are for others to get
    involved.

1.  *Recognize contributions.* Everyone likes to be appreciated, so
    communities should acknowledge their members' contributions both
    publicly and privately.

1.  *Make space.* Micromanaging or trying to control everything
    centrally means people won't feel they have the autonomy to act,
    which will probably cause them to drift away.  In particular, if
    you're too engaged or too quick on the reply button, people have
    less opportunity to grow as members and to create horizontal
    collaborations.  The community can continue to be "hub and spoke",
    focused around one or two individuals, rather than a
    highly-connected network in which others feel comfortable
    participating.

Another way to make participation rewarding is to provide training.
Organizations require committees, meetings, budgets, grant proposals,
and dispute resolution; most people are never taught how to do any of
this, any more than they are taught how to teach, but training people
to do these things helps your organization run more smoothly, and the
opportunity to gain transferable skills is a powerful reason for
people to get and stay involved.  If you are going to do this, don't
try to provide the training yourself (unless it's what you specialize
in).  Many civic and community groups have programs of this kind, and
you can probably make a deal with one of them.

Other groups may be useful in other ways as well, and you may be
useful to themâ€“if not immediately, then tomorrow or next year.  You
should therefore set aside an hour or two every month to find allies
and maintain your relationships with them.  One way to do this is to
ask them for advice: how do they think you ought to raise awareness of
what you're doing? Where have they found space to run classes?  What
needs do they think aren't being met, and would you be able to meet
them (either on your own, or in partnership with them)?  Any group
that has been around for a few years will have useful advice; they
will also be flattered to be asked, and will know who you are the next
time you call.

One important special case of making things rewarding is to pay
people.  Volunteers can do a lot, but eventually tasks like system
administration and accounting need full-time paid staff.  This is
often a difficult transition for grassroots organizations, but is
outside the scope of this book.

## Governance

As Jo Freeman pointed out in her influential essay "[The Tyranny of
Structurelessness][freeman]", every organization has a power
structure: the only question is whether it's formal and accountable,
or informal and unaccountable.  Make yours one of the first kind:
write and publish the rules governing everything from who's allowed to
use the name and logo to who gets to decide whether people are allowed
to charge money to teach with whatever materials your group has worked
up.

Organizations can govern themselves in many different ways, and a full
discussion of the options is outside the scope of this book.  The most
important thing to keep in mind is that countries and corporations are
only two of many governance models, and that a commons is often a
better model for volunteer teaching organizations.  A commons is
"something managed jointly by a community according to rules they
themselves have evolved and adopted"; as
[[Bollier2014](biblio.html#bollier-commoner)] emphasizes, all three
parts of that definition are essential: a commons isn't just a shared
pasture, but also includes the community that shares it and the rules
they use to do so.

Most resources, throughout most of human history, have been commons:
it is only in the last few hundred years that impersonal markets have
pushed them to the margins.  In order to do so, free-market advocates
have had to convince us we're something we're not (dispassionate
calculators of individual advantage) and erase or devalue local
knowledge and custom.  Both have had tragic consequences for us
individually and communally, and now for our whole planet.

Since society has difficulty recognizing commons organizations, and
since most of the people you will want to recruit don't have
experience with them, you will probably wind up having some sort of
board, a director, and other staff.  Broadly speaking, your
organization can have either a *service board*, whose members also
take on other roles in the organization, or a *governance board* whose
primary responsibility is to hire, monitor, and if need be fire the
director.  Board members can be elected by the community or appointed;
in either case, it's important to prioritize competence over passion
(the latter being more important for the rank and file), and to try to
recruit for particular skills such as accounting, marketing, and so
on.

Don't worry about drafting a constitution when you first get started:
it will only result in endless wrangling about what we're going to do
rather than formalization of what you're already doing.  When the time
does come to formalize your rules, though, make your organization a
democracy: sooner or later (usually sooner), every appointed board
turns into a mutual agreement society and loses sight of what the
community it's meant to serve actually needs.  Giving the community
power is messy, but is the only way invented so far to ensure that an
organization continues to meet people's actual needs.

## Final Thoughts

As [[Pigni2016](biblio.html#pigni-idealists)] discusses, burnout is a
chronic risk in any community activity.  If you don't take care of
yourself, you won't be able to take care of your community.

Every organization eventually needs fresh ideas and fresh leadership.
When that time comes, train your successors and then move on.  They
will undoubtedly do things you wouldn't have, but the same is true of
every generation.  Few things in life are as satisfying as watching
something you helped build take on a life of its own.  Celebrate
thatâ€“you won't have any trouble finding something else to keep you
busy.

## Challenges

Several of these exercises are taken from
[[Brown2007](biblio.html#brown-bpco)], which is an exceptionally
useful book on building community organizations.

### Who Are You? (20 minutes)

Read NOAA's descriptions of [disruptive behaviors][noaa-disruptive].

1.  Which of them best describes you?
2.  Do you think the strategies described for handling people like
    you are effective?
3.  Are other strategies equally or more effective?

### People You May Meet (30 minutes)

As an organizer, part of your job is sometimes to help people find a
way to contribute despite themselves.  In small groups, pick three of
the people below and discuss how you would help them become a better
contributor to your organization.

*   *Anna* knows more about every subject than everyone else put
    togetherâ€“at least, she thinks she does. No matter what you say,
    she'll correct you; no matter what you know, she knows
    better.

*   *Catherine* has so little confidence in her own ability that she
    won't make any decision, no matter how small, until she has
    checked with someone else.

*   *Frank* believes that knowledge is power, and enjoys knowing things
    that other people don't.  He can make things work, but when asked
    how he did it, he'll grin and say, "Oh, I'm sure you can figure it
    out."

*   *Hediyeh* is quiet. She never speaks up in meetings, even when she
    knows that what other people are saying is wrong. She might
    contribute to the mailing list, but she's very sensitive to
    criticism, and will always back down rather than defending her
    point of view. Hediyeh isn't a troublemaker, but rather a lost
    opportunity.

*   *Kenny* has discovered that most people would rather shoulder his
    share of the work than complain about him, and he takes advantage
    of it at every turn. The frustrating thing is that he's so damn
    *plausible* when someone finally does confront him. "There have
    been mistakes on all sides," he says, or, "Well, I think you're
    nit-picking."

*   *Melissa* means well, but somehow something always comes up, and her
    tasks are never finished until the last possible moment. Of
    course, that means that everyone who is depending on her can't do
    their work until *after* the last possible moment...

*   *Raj* is rude. "It's just the way I talk," he says, "If you can't
    hack it, maybe you should find another team." His favorite phrase
    is, "That's stupid," and he uses obscenity as casually as minor
    characters in Tarantino films.
