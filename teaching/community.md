# Building Community

1.  **Do the reading.**
    People have been writing about their experiences with grassroots organizing for decades.
    Two resources that are particularly useful are
    *[Building Powerful Community Organizations](biblio.html#brown-bpco)*
    and *[Producing Open Source Software](biblio.html#fogel-poss)*.

1.  **Join, don't start.**
    Hundreds of organizations devoted to teaching already exist,
    from professional associations to community groups focusing on local needs.
    Before creating a new one,
    see if there's one you could join:
    this will give you a head start
    and a chance to learn more about how to run things.

1.  **Make it a democracy.**
    Sooner or later,
    every appointed board turns into a mutual agreement society.
    Giving the community power is messy,
    but is the only way to ensure that
    an organization continues to meet the actual needs of the people it's supposed to be helping.

1.  **Make it rewarding.**
    The community organizer [Saul Alinksy](biblio.html#alinsky-rules) said,
    "If your people aren't having a ball doing it, there is something very wrong."
    Community members won't enjoy every moment of their work,
    but if they don't enjoy any of it,
    they won't stay.
    One way to reward them is to thank them:
    people will often do more for a simple "thank you" than they will do for a hundred dollars.

1.  **Provide training.**
    Organizations require committees, meetings, budgets, grant proposals, and dispute resolution.
    Most researchers are never taught how to do any of this,
    despite the fact that universities depend on them too.
    Training people to do these things helps your organization run more smoothly,
    and gives participants a powerful reason to get and stay involved.
    If you aren't large enough to provide training,
    join an organization that is and take some of theirs.
    As with Rule 2,
    it's always best to learn on someone else's project before starting your own.

1.  **Communicate.**
    Nobody's going to come to a meeting unless they know about it,
    and nobody's going to help you raise money if they don't know how you're going to spend it.
    Mailing lists, blogs, and Twitter all give you ways to stay in touch.
    Use them sparingly so that your audience isn't overwhelmed,
    but use them.
    If you're unsure what to say,
    *[Marketing for Scientists](biblio.html#kuchner-marketing)* is a good place to start for guidance.

1.  **Write down the rules.**
    As Jo Freeman described in "[The Tyranny of Structurelessness][structurelessness]",
    every organization has a power structure:
    the only question is whether it's formal and accountable,
    or informal and unaccountable.
    Make yours one of the first kind:
    write and publish the rules governing everything from
    who gets to decide when the next workshop is going to be held
    and who's allowed to use the name and logo
    to what constitutes inappropriate conduct and how complaints about it will be handled.
    (This [model anti-harassment policy][coc] is a good start.)
    
1.  **Enforce those rules.**
    Many communities have fallen apart because they were unable or unwilling to enforce their own rules.
    Remember: a community's actual culture is defined by what the people in charge will allow.

1.  **Make space.**
    If you're too engaged or too quick on the reply button,
    people have less opportunity to grow as members
    and to create horizontal collaborations.
    The community can continue to be "hub and spoke",
    focused around one or two individuals,
    rather than a highly-connected network
    in which others feel comfortable participating.

1.  **Soup, then hymns.**
    Manifestos are great,
    but most people join a volunteer community to help and be helped.
    Focus on things that are immediately useful,
    e.g.,
    on what can people create that will be used by other community members write away.
    Once your organization shows that it can actually achieve things---even small things---people
    will be more confident that it's worth thinking about bigger issues.

1.  **Don't be afraid to pay some people.**
    Volunteers can do a lot,
    but eventually tasks like accounting and event coordination need paid staff
    to ensure quality and continuity.
    Many grassroots groups stumble when they first have to decide who will be paid and who won't;
    one way to avoid trouble is to make a plan well in advance that makes it clear that some people are *going* to be paid,
    so that when they are,
    it won't come as a surprise.
    
1.  **Trust people.**
    Micromanaging makes people feel that they aren't trusted,
    which in turn makes them less motivated.
    Responsibility and power should always go hand-in-hand.

1.  **Look after yourself.**
    Burnout is a chronic risk in any community activity.
    If you don't take care of yourself,
    you won't be able to take care of your community.
    *[The Idealist's Survival Kit](biblio.html#pigni-idealists)* has a lot of advice,
    the most useful of which is just to talk to people.

1.  **Move on.**
    Every organization eventually needs fresh ideas and fresh leadership.
    When that time comes,
    train your successors and then move on.
    They will undoubtedly do things you wouldn't have,
    but the same is true of every generation.
    Few things in life are as satisfying as
    watching something you helped build take on a life of its own.
    Celebrate that---you won't have any trouble finding
    something else to keep you busy.
