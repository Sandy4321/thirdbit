# Building Community

One person can only do so much.
Just as we learn best together,
we teach best when we are teaching with other people,
and the best way to achieve that is to build a community.

A framework in which to think about doing this is
_[situated learning](gloss.html#situated-learning)_,
which focuses on how _[legitimate peripheral participation](gloss.html#legitimate-peripheral-participation)_
leads to people becoming members of a _[community of practice](gloss.html#community-of-practice)_.
Unpacking those terms,
a community of practice is a group of people bound together by interest in some activity,
such as knitting or particle physics.
Legitimate peripheral participation means doing simple, low-risk tasks
that community nevertheless recognizes as valid contributions:
making your first scarf,
stuffing envelopes during an election campaign,
or proof-reading documentation for open source software.

Situated learning focuses on
the transition from being a newcomer to being accepted as a peer
by those who are already community members.
This typically means starting with simplified tasks and tools,
then doing similar tasks with more complex tools,
and finally tackling the challenges of advanced practitioners.
For example,
children learning music may start by playing nursery rhymes on a recorder or ukulele,
then play other simple songs on a trumpet or saxophone in a band,
and finally start exploring their own musical tastes.
Healthy communities understand and support these progressions,
and recognize that each step is meant to give people a ramp rather than a cliff.

Whatever the domain,
situated learning emphasizes that learning is a social activity.
In order to be effective and sustainable,
teaching therefore needs to be rooted in a community;
if one doesn't exist,
you need to build one.

## Learn, Then Do

The first step in building a community is to decide if you really need to,
or whether you would be more effective joining an existing organization.
Thousands of groups are already teaching people tech skills,
from the [4-H Club][4h] and [literacy programs][frontier-college]
to get-into-coding non-profits like [Black Girls Code][bgc].
Joining an existing group will give you a head start on teaching,
an immediate set of colleagues,
and a chance to learn more about how to run things.
The only thing it *won't* give you is the ego gratification and control
that comes from being a founder.

Whether you join an existing group or set up one of your own,
you owe it to yourself and everyone who's going to work with you
to find out what's been done before.
People have been writing about grassroots organizing for decades;
[[Alinsky1989](biblio.html#alinsky-rules)] is probably the best-known work on the subject,
while [[Brown2007](biblio.html#brown-bpco)]
and [[Midwest2010](biblio.html#midwest-organizing)]
are practical manuals rooted in decades of practice.
If you want to read more deeply,
[[Adams1975](biblio.html#adams-seeds)] is a history of the Highlander Folk School,
whose approach has been emulated by many successful groups,
while [[Spalding2014](biblio.html#spalding-adults)] is a guide to teaching adults
written by someone with deep personal roots in organizing.

## Engagement

The community organizer Saul Alinksy said,
"If your people aren't having a ball doing it, there is something very wrong."
Community members shouldn't expect to enjoy every moment of their work with your organization,
but if they don't enjoy any of it,
they won't stay.
One way to do this is to thank people:
everyone likes to be appreciated,
and communities should acknowledge their members' contributions both publicly and privately.

The [Ben Franklin Effect][franklin-effect]: a person who has performed
a favor for someone is more likely to do another favor for that person
than they would be if they had received a favor from that person.
- Works equally well for good or evil.

FIXME: ask people what they want rather than guessing.

FIXME: soup, then hymns.
Manifestos are great,
but most people join a volunteer community to help and be helped.
Focus on things that are immediately useful,
e.g.,
on what can people create that will be used by other community members write away.
Once your organization shows that it can actually achieve things–even small things–people
will be more confident that it's worth thinking about bigger issues.

One way to make participation rewarding is to provide training.
Organizations require committees, meetings, budgets, grant proposals, and dispute resolution;
most people are never taught how to do any of this,
any more than they are taught how to teach,
but training people to do these things helps your organization run more smoothly,
and the opportunity to gain transferable skills
is a powerful reason for people to get and stay involved.

FIXME: borrow training, don't do it yourself.

One important special case of making things rewarding is to pay people.
Volunteers can do a lot,
but tasks like system administration and accounting need full-time paid staff.
FIXME: difficult transition.

Micromanaging or trying to control everything centrally
means people won't feel they have the autonomy to act,
which will probably cause them to drift away.
In particular,
if you're too engaged or too quick on the reply button,
people have less opportunity to grow as members
and to create horizontal collaborations.
The community can continue to be "hub and spoke",
focused around one or two individuals,
rather than a highly-connected network
in which others feel comfortable participating.

FIXME: pathways to contribution (examples).

Plan for a cycle:
- Recruitment.
- Retention.
- Retirement (from your organization at least).

Recruitment:
- Share stories that exemplify the kind of actions you want.
- Have newcomers take part in group activities before solo activities.
- Give newcomers a mentor.
  - Give the mentors some training.
  - Make sure the mentors mentor.
  - Most important activity is to fill in the unwritten rules.

Retention:
- Provide many ways to contribute (so that as people's lives change, they can still take part).
- Make sure that authority and responsibility go hand-in-hand.
- Recognize contributions.

Retirement:
- Make sure knowledge is passed on.
- Make sure final thoughts on changes are listened to (even if they're not acted on).

Find allies.
- Have you ever spoken to someone from your college or school board PR office, or yo city councilor's office?
- Start building that relationship early by asking for help.
  - How do they think you ought to raise awareness of what you're doing?
  - They'll have useful advice, be flattered to be asked, and will know who you are when you have something to say.

The bigger picture.
- Combine marketing what you do in particular with marketing the subject as a whole.
- There's room enough for everyone, so join forces with other groups.
  - Referrals.

### People You Don't Want On Your Team

*Anna* knows more about every subject than everyone else on the team
put together–at least, she thinks she does. No matter what you say,
she'll correct you; no matter what you know, she knows better. Annas
are pretty easy to spot: if you keep track in team meetings of how
often people interrupt one another, her score is usually higher than
everyone else's put together.

*Bao* is a contrarian: no matter what anyone says, he'll take the
opposite side. This is healthy in small doses, but when Bao does it,
there's always another objection lurking behind the first half dozen.

*Catherine* has so little confidence in her own ability (despite her
good grades) that she won't make any decision, no matter how small,
until she has checked with someone else. Everything has to be spelled
out in detail for her so that there's no possibility of her getting
anything wrong.

*Frank* believes that knowledge is power. He enjoys knowing things
that other people don't–or to be more accurate, he enjoys it when
people know he knows things they don't. Frank can actually make things
work, but when asked how he did it, he'll grin and say, "Oh, I'm sure
you can figure it out."

*Hediyeh* is quiet. Very quiet. She never speaks up in meetings, even
when she knows that what other people are saying is wrong. She might
contribute to the mailing list, but she's very sensitive to criticism,
and will always back down rather than defending her point of
view. Hediyeh isn't a troublemaker, but rather a lost opportunity.

*Kenny* is a hitchhiker. He has discovered that most people would
rather shoulder some extra work than snitch, and he takes advantage of
it at every turn. The frustrating thing is that he's so damn
*plausible* when someone finally does confront him. "There have been
mistakes on all sides," he says, or, "Well, I think you're
nit-picking." The only way to deal with Kenny is to stand up to him:
remember, if he's not doing his share, *he's the bad guy*, not you.

*Melissa* would easily have made the varsity procrastination team if
she'd bothered to show up to tryouts. She means well–she really does
feel bad about letting people down–but somehow something always comes
up, and her tasks are never finished until the last possible
moment. Of course, that means that everyone who is depending on her
can't do their work until *after* the last possible moment...

*Petra*'s favorite phrase is "why don't we". Why don't we write a GUI
to help people edit the program's configuration files? Hey, why don't
we invent our own little language for designing GUIs? Her energy and
enthusiasm are hard to argue with, but argue you must. Otherwise, for
every step you move forward, the project's goalposts will recede by
two. This is called feature creep, and has ruined many projects that
might otherwise have delivered something small, but useful.

*Raj* is rude. "It's just the way I talk," he says, "If you can't hack
it, maybe you should find another team." His favorite phrase is,
"That's stupid," and he uses obscenity as casually as minor characters
in Tarantino films. His only redeeming grace is that he can't
dissemble in front of the instructor as well as Kenny, so he's easier
to get rid of.

*Sergei* is simply incompetent. He doesn't understand the problem, he
hasn't bothered to master the tools and libraries he's supposed to be
using, the code he checks in doesn't compile, and his thirty-second
bug fixes introduce more problems than they solve. If he means well,
try to re-partition the work so that he'll do less damage. If he
doesn't, he should be treated like any other hitchhiker.

## Governance

As Jo Freeman pointed out in her influential essay
"[The Tyranny of Structurelessness][freeman]",
every organization has a power structure:
the only question is whether it's formal and accountable,
or informal and unaccountable.
Make yours one of the first kind:
write and publish the rules governing everything from
who's allowed to use the name and logo
to who gets to decide whether people are allowed to charge money to teach
with whatever materials your group has worked up.

FIXME: don't do this too soon,
since it results in endless wrangling about what we're going to do
rather than formalization of what we're already doing.

When the time comes to formalize your rules,
make your organization a democracy:
sooner or later (usually sooner),
every appointed board turns into a mutual agreement society
and loses sight of what the community it's meant to serve actually needs.
Giving the community power is messy,
but is the only way invented so far to ensure that
an organization continues to meet people's actual needs.

FIXME: borrow a constitution.

FIXME: distinguish service board from governance board.

FIXME: measurement
- Don't fetishize quantification.
- Define goals in a way that will allow an unbiased outsider to tell
  if they've been met or not.
- First-time goal is often "measure X".
  - Otherwise, you're pulling a target out of thin air.
- If you don't make your goal, do a retrospective to ask what to do differently next time:
  - Unrealistic goal?
  - Resources not allocated properly?

When choosing a board:
- Prioritize competence over passion (the latter is for the rank and file).
- Recruit to fill gaps (accounting, marketing, evaluation, etc.).

Countries and corporations are only two of many governance models.
- The commons is often a better model for teaching organizations.
- "Something managed jointly by a community according to rules they themselves have evolved and adopted."
- As [[Bollier2014](biblio.html#bollier-commoner)] repeatedly emphasizes,
  all three parts of that equation are essential:
  a commons isn't just a thing,
  like a shared pasture,
  but is necessarily also comprised of a community who share it and the rules they use to do so.
- Most resources, throughout most of human history, have been commons:
  it is only in the last few hundred years that impersonal markets have pushed them to the margins.
  In order to do so,
  free-market advocates have had to convince us we're something we're not
  (dispassionate calculators of individual advantage)
  and erase or devalue local knowledge and custom.
  Both have had tragic consequences for us individually and communally,
  and now for our whole planet.

## Final Thoughts

As [[Pigni2016](biblio.html#pigni-idealists)] discusses,
burnout is a chronic risk in any community activity.
If you don't take care of yourself,
you won't be able to take care of your community.

Every organization eventually needs fresh ideas and fresh leadership.
When that time comes,
train your successors and then move on.
They will undoubtedly do things you wouldn't have,
but the same is true of every generation.
Few things in life are as satisfying as
watching something you helped build take on a life of its own.
Celebrate that–you won't have any trouble finding
something else to keep you busy.
