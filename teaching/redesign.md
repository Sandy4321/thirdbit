# Design Notes for Version 3
<!--: \label{redesign} :-->

## 1. Brainstorming

*These questions and answers provide a rough scope for the material.*

1.  What problems will learners learn how to solve?
    1.  How to design a short course for adults.
    1.  How to deliver hands-on in-person instruction in computing skills.
    1.  What kinds of content belong in such a course.
    1.  How to deliver such a course in an automated way.
    1.  How to build a teaching community.
1.  What problems will learners *not* learn how to solve (i.e., what is out of scope)?
    1.  How to teach children or people with special learning needs (though many of the ideas that are taught will transfer).
    1.  How to rigorously assess the impact of training of this kind (though informal self-assessment will be included).
    1.  How to design and deliver entire degree programs and other extended curriculum.
1.  What concepts and techniques will learners encounter?
    1.  Bloom's Taxonomy.
    1.  Branding.
    1.  Cognitive load.
    1.  Collaborative lesson development.
    1.  Commons.
    1.  Concept mapping.
    1.  Dunning-Kruger effect.
    1.  Expert blind spot.
    1.  Fixed vs. growth mindset.
    1.  Formative vs. summative assesment.
    1.  Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation.
    1.  *Jugyokenkyu* (lesson study).
    1.  Learner personas.
    1.  Legitimate peripheral participation in a community of practice.
    1.  Live coding (teaching as a performance art).
    1.  Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK).
    1.  Peer instruction.
    1.  Reflective (deliberate) practice.
    1.  Reverse instructional design (understanding by design).
    1.  Working vs. persistent memory (7Â±2).
1.  What mistakes or misconceptions will they have?
    1.  Children and adults learn the same way.
    1.  Computing education should be for and about computer science.
    1.  Programming skill is innate.
    1.  Student evaluations of courses are indicative of learning outcomes.
    1.  Teaching ability is innate.
    1.  The best way to teach is to throw people in at the deep end.
    1.  The best way to teach is to use "real" tools right from the start.
    1.  VAK learning styles are real.
    1.  Women just don't like programming or innately have less aptitude.
1.  In what contexts will this material be used?
    1.  A one-semester undergraduate course for computer science majors interested in education.
    1.  Self-study or guided study for people in tech who want to volunteer with grassroots get-into-coding initiatives.
1.  What kinds of exercises will learners do?
    1.  Create multiple choice questions whose incorrect answers have diagnostic power.
    1.  Give feedback on a recorded teaching episode and compare points with expert feedback.
    1.  Create a Parsons Problem.
    1.  Create a short debugging exercise.
    1.  Explain personal motivation for teaching.
