    1.  How to build a community of practice around development and delivery of shared instructional materials.
    1.  How to communicate the value of their training to specific audiences.
1.  What problems will learners *not* learn how to solve (i.e., what is out of scope)?
    1.  How to teach children or people with special learning needs.
    1.  How to assess the impact of training of this kind.
    1.  How to design and deliver courses for human-mediated over-the-web delivery.
