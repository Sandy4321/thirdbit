A task which contains important elements of things that learners would
do in real (non-classroom) situations.  To be authentic, a task should
require learners to construct their own answers rather than choose
between provided answers, and to work with the same tools and data
they would use in real life.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Behaviorism</strong>:
<a name="behaviorism"></a>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Cognitivism</strong>:
