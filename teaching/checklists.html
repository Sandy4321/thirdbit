title: "How to Teach Programming (and Other Things): Checklists"
---
<h1 id="checklists">Checklists</h1>
<p>Atul Gawande&apos;s 2007 article &quot;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist" target="_blank">The Checklist</a>&quot;
popularized the idea that using checklists can save lives (and make
many other things better too).  The results of recent studies have
been more nuanced [<a href="biblio.html#aveling-checklists">Aveling2013</a>],
[<a href="biblio.html#urbach-checklists">Urbach2014</a>], but we still find them
useful, particularly when bringing new instructors onto a team.</p>
<p>The checklists below are used before, during, and after instructor
training events, and can easily be adapted for end-learner workshops
as well.  We recommend that every group build and maintain its own
checklists customized for its instructors&apos; and learners&apos; needs.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling-the-event">Scheduling the Event</h2>
<ol>
<li>Decide if it will be in person, online for one site, or online for
several sites.</li>
<li>Talk through expectations with the host(s) and make sure that
everyone agrees on who is covering travel costs.</li>
<li>Determine who is allowed to take part: is the event open to all
comers, restricted to members of one organization, or something in
between?</li>
<li>Arrange trainers.</li>
<li>Arrange space, including breakout rooms for video recording.</li>
<li>Choose dates.
If it is in person, book travel.</li>
<li>Get names and email addresses of attendees from host(s).</li>
