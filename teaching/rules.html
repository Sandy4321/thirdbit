<h1 id="the-rules">The Rules</h1>
<p>It&apos;s impossible to put
everything that matters about teaching and learning
on a single page,
but these ten points are always worth remembering.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Be kind: all else is details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never teach alone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No lesson survives first contact with learners.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Every lesson is too short from the teacher&apos;s point of view
and too long from the learner&apos;s.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Every mistake is a lesson.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;I learned this a long time ago&quot; is not the same as &quot;this is easy&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can&apos;t help everyone, but you can always help someone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
