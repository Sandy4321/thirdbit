My one issue is the "People you don't want on your team" section. The
way it's framed seems exclusionary, and like you're advising leaders
to screen potential volunteers for such problems (and let's be honest,
all of us fall into these personality types at various points in
time). I like the juxtaposition of some of the characters: for
example, Hediyeh not being a troublemaker but lost opportunity. It
would be awesome to have ways to craft the others into a positive
role, or suggestions to mitigate these behaviors, but that seems
outside the scope of the conversation (although there might be decent
resources on people/meeting management that could be cited). Another
way to manage this section is an acknowledgement that community
dynamics matter, and perhaps not everyone is suited to work together
or in particular capacities.
