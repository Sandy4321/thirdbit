<h1 id="why-i-teach">Why I Teach</h1>
<p>When I first started volunteering at the University of Toronto,
students sometimes asked me why I did it. This was my answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was your age, I thought universities existed to teach people
how to learn. Later, in grad school, I thought universities were about
doing research and creating new knowledge. Now that I&apos;m in my forties,
though, I&apos;ve realized that what we&apos;re really teaching you is how to
take over the world, because you&apos;re going to have to one day whether
you like it or not.</p>
<p>My parents are in their seventies. They don&apos;t run the world any
more: it&apos;s people my age who pass laws, set interest rates, and make
life-and-death decisions in hospitals. As scary as it is, <em>we</em> have
become the grownups.</p>
<p>Twenty years from now, though, we&apos;ll be heading for retirement and
<em>you</em> will be in charge.  That may sound like a long time when
you&apos;re nineteen, but take three breaths and it&apos;s gone. That&apos;s why we
give you problems whose answers can&apos;t be cribbed from last year&apos;s
notes. That&apos;s why we put you in situations where you have to figure
out what needs to be done right now, what can be left for later, and
what you can simply ignore. It&apos;s because if you don&apos;t learn how to
do these things now, you won&apos;t be ready to do them when you have to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&apos;s all true, but isn&apos;t the whole story. I don&apos;t want people to make
the world a better place so that I can retire in comfort. I want them
to do it because it&apos;s the greatest adventure of our time. A hundred
and fifty years ago, most societies still practiced slavery. A hundred
years ago, when my grandmother was young, she <a href="http://www.canuck.com/famous5/html/history.html" target="_blank">wasn&apos;t legally a
person</a> in Canada.  Fifty years ago, most of the world&apos;s
people suffered under totalitarian rule; in the year I was born,
judges could&#x2013;and did&#x2013;order electroshock therapy to &quot;cure&quot; homosexuals.
Yes, there&apos;s still a lot wrong with the world, but look at how many
more choices we have than our grandparents did. Look at how many more
things we can know, and be, and enjoy.</p>
<p>This didn&apos;t happen by chance. It happened because millions of people
made millions of little decisions, the sum of which was a better
world. We don&apos;t think of these day-to-day decisions as political, but
every time we buy one brand of running shoe instead of another or
shout an anatomical insult instead of a racial one at a cab driver,
we&apos;re choosing one vision of the world instead of another.</p>
<p>In his 1947 essay &quot;<a href="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/whywrite.html" target="_blank">Why I Write</a>&quot;, George Orwell
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive
books, and might have remained almost unaware of my political
loyalties. As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of
pamphleteer&#x2026; Every line of serious work that I have written since
1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against
totalitarianism&#x2026; It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own,
to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone
writes of them in one guise or another. It is simply a question of
which side one takes&#x2026;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Replace &quot;writing&quot; with &quot;teaching&quot; and you&apos;ll have the reason I do what
I do. The world doesn&apos;t get better on its own. It gets better because
people make it better: penny by penny, vote by vote, and one lesson at
a time.</p>
