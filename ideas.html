  <h1>Ideas</h1>

  <p>
    These ideas are ranked roughly from those on which progress has been made to those that are still pipe dreams.
    If you'd like to help with any of them,
    or take one on yourself,
    please let me know.

    <dt>Teach programmers how to run grassroots get-into-coding groups</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Programmers create get-into-coding groups so that people won't have to teach themselves how to write Javascript,
        then reinvent wheels when it comes to teaching, running a non-profit, or organizing a community.
        I am adding a section to <a href="/teaching/"><em>How to Teach</em></a> that draws on
        the experience of <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>
        and books like
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-Powerful-Community-Organizations-Personal/dp/0977151808/"><em>Building Powerful Community Organizations</em></a>
        to fill that gap.

    <dt>Develop a course in empirical software engineering</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        <a href="http://third-bit.com/2014/10/02/a-better-software-engineering-course.html">This post</a> describes the idea,
        and <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/11/29/exaptation.html">this one</a> explains why the time is right.
        I'm hoping to use my job at <a href="http://datacamp.com">DataCamp</a> to push this forward.

        Allow people to create synchronized voiceovers for HTML slideshows.
        I've had several summer students take a run at this;
        the hard part is the authoring tool to add time marks,
        but as the demo linked in the title shows,
        the idea itself works.

        Your graduate degree is in ecology,
        but now you're running a three-person team responsible for building and maintaining a hundred thousand lines of code?
        This book (or course, or whatever) is everything you absolutely, positively need to know
        <em>after</em> you know how to program.
        (We've <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/managing-research-software-projects/short/">started work</a> on this,
        but more hands would be welcome.)

      <p>
        I firmly believe that the Kernighan Trilogy
        (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/020103669X/"><em>Software Tools</em></a>,
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unix-Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/013937681X/"><em>The Unix Programming Environment</em></a>,
        and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/"><em>The C Programming Language</em></a>)
        are the main reason that Unix succeeded.
        I would really like an update that uses a modern operating system and a modern programming language (preferably functional),
        and takes Udell's <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2011/01/24/seven-ways-to-think-like-the-web/">seven ways to think like the web</a> to heart.
        Udell's <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/elmcity-project-faq/">Elm City</a> calendar syndication project would be a great running exampleâ€¦

    <dt>An Empirical Comparison of the Syntax of Python, R, MATLAB, and Julia</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        We tried to repeat <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/2014/01/29/stefik-siebert-syntax.html">Stefik et al's study of programming language syntax</a>
        for languages commonly used in science,
        but weren't able to get enough subjects.
        I think it's worth trying again,
        both for its own sake and to show that this kind of work can and should be done.

    <dt><a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#fh"><em>500 Lines or Less</em></a> - for science!</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Can you write a climate simulator in less than 500 lines of Python?
        What about constructing phylogenetic trees in less than 500 lines of R?
        This collection would show readers how science is turned into code across a broad range of disciplines.
        Each entry is 200-300 lines of scientific code,
        and another 200-300 lines showing readers how to <em>test</em> simple versions of a broad range of scientific applications.

    <dt><em>A Hundred Broken Programs</em></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        In the spirit of Johnson's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GUI-Bloopers-2-0-Second-Technologies/dp/0123706432/"><em>GUI Bloopers</em></a>,
        I'd like a book that teaches debugging by working through a hundred short examples,
        each showing a different kind of fault, a different method of diagnosis, or a different kind of fix,
        from type-checking during compilation to exception handling, rolling back transactions, and re-starting servers.

    <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discussion-Book-Great-People-Talking/dp/1119049717/"><em>The Discussion Book</em></a> online</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Today's MOOC platforms use the Internet like television.
        What would they look like if they directly supported some of the techniques described in
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discussion-Book-Great-People-Talking/dp/1119049717/">this useful book</a>?
        Similarly,
        just as MOOCs are mistakenly treating the Internet like television,
        Caulfield's notion of <a href="https://hapgood.us/2016/05/13/choral-explanations/">choral explanations</a> has me thinking that
        I've been mistaken in trying to treat lesson construction as software development.
        A "lesson" platform that uses Stack Overflow as its model rather than GitHub or Wikipedia
        would be fascinating to explore,
        as would <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2016/09/12/collaborative-choral-software-exegesis.html">collaborative choral software exegesis</a>.

    <dt>Using machine learning to find <em>actual</em> design patterns</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        I often use Sajaniemi et al's <a href="http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~saja/var_roles/stud_vers/stud_Python3_eng.html">roles of variables</a> in teaching,
        but like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/">the classic design patterns</a>,
        they were "discovered" by eyeballing novice code.
        I think that cluster analysis of patterns of class and variable use would uncover more patterns,
        and confirm my suspicion that some of the classics are really just different names for the same thing.
        Similarly,
        I think that analysis of actual usage patterns could lay the foundation for
        <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2017/09/30/git-graphs-and-engineering.html">the design of a better version control system</a>.

    <dt><em>The Undergraduate Operator's Manual</em></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        I would really like to run a one-semester course for first-year undergraduates whose subject was themselves.
        What happens in your brain when you learn something, and how can you learn more efficiently?
        What's the effect of sleep deprivation on the quality of work?
        How can you analyze the social dynamics of a classroom, or change them to make participation fairer?
        How can you run a small group project?
        Who decides what gets taught at universities and who gets to take part?

    <dt><em>Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code: What Everyone in Tech Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Power, Money, and Politics</em></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Inspired in equal parts by <a href="https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook"><em>The Imposter's Handbook</em></a>,
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Future-Presidents-Science-Headlines/dp/0393337111/"><em>Physics for Future Presidents</em></a>,
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economics-Everyone-Second-Short-Capitalism/dp/0745335780/"><em>Economics for Everyone</em></a>,
        <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/">Joel Spolsky's explanation on Unicode</a>,
        and the political events of 2017,
        this book would teach people in tech with privileged backgrounds (like mine) about the realities of gender, race, and class.
        I tried crowdsourcing this in late 2017 and early 2017,
        but it never came together;
        in the long run,
        this could well be the most important entry in this list.
