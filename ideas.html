  <h1>Ideas</h1>

  <p>
    These ideas are ranked roughly from those on which progress has been made to those that are still pipe dreams.
    If you'd like to help with any of them,
    or take one on yourself,
    please let me know.
    And please also check out [my list of unwritten books]({{site.github.url}}/not-on-the-shelves/2017.html):
    it may be old-fashioned,
    but I still believe that a good book can change the world.

    <dt>Teach programmers how to run grassroots get-into-coding groups</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Programmers create get-into-coding groups so that people won't have to teach themselves how to write Javascript,
        then reinvent wheels when it comes to teaching, running a non-profit, or organizing a community.
        I am adding a section to <a href="/teaching/"><em>How to Teach</em></a> that draws on
        the experience of <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>
        and books like
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-Powerful-Community-Organizations-Personal/dp/0977151808/"><em>Building Powerful Community Organizations</em></a>
        to fill that gap.

      <p>
        Allow people to create synchronized voiceovers for HTML slideshows.
        I've had several summer students take a run at this;
        the hard part is the authoring tool to add time marks,
        but as the demo linked in the title shows,
        the idea itself works.

    <dt>An empirical comparison of the syntax of Python, R, MATLAB, and Julia</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        We tried to repeat <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/2014/01/29/stefik-siebert-syntax.html">Stefik et al's study of programming language syntax</a>
        for languages commonly used in science,
        but weren't able to get enough subjects.
        I think it's worth trying again,
        both for its own sake and to show that this kind of work can and should be done.

      <p>
        Today's MOOC platforms use the Internet like television.
        What would they look like if they directly supported some of the techniques described in
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discussion-Book-Great-People-Talking/dp/1119049717/">this useful book</a>?
        Similarly,
        just as MOOCs are mistakenly treating the Internet like television,
        Caulfield's notion of <a href="https://hapgood.us/2016/05/13/choral-explanations/">choral explanations</a> has me thinking that
        I've been mistaken in trying to treat lesson construction as software development.
        A "lesson" platform that uses Stack Overflow as its model rather than GitHub or Wikipedia
        would be fascinating to explore,
        as would <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2016/09/12/collaborative-choral-software-exegesis.html">collaborative choral software exegesis</a>.

    <dt>Using machine learning to find <em>actual</em> design patterns</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        I often use Sajaniemi et al's <a href="http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~saja/var_roles/stud_vers/stud_Python3_eng.html">roles of variables</a> in teaching,
        but like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/">the classic design patterns</a>,
        they were "discovered" by eyeballing novice code.
        I think that cluster analysis of patterns of class and variable use would uncover more patterns,
        and confirm my suspicion that some of the classics are really just different names for the same thing.
        Similarly,
        I think that analysis of actual usage patterns could lay the foundation for
        <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2017/09/30/git-graphs-and-engineering.html">the design of a better version control system</a>.
