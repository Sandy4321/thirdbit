<h4><a href="{{site.github.url}}/lessons-learned/">Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned</a></h4>

<p>
  Since its start in 1998, Software Carpentry has evolved from a
  week-long training course at the US national laboratories into a
  worldwide volunteer effort to improve researchers' computing
  skills. This talk will explore the lessons we've learned along the
  way about applying open source software development techniques to
  teaching at scale, and about getting people and institutions to
  change the way they work.

<p>
  Hundreds of books about writing compilers are currently on the
  market, but there are only three about writing debuggers.
  Spreadsheets are used to do calculations more often than every other
  kind of tool combined, but thirty-five years after their invention,
  version control systems still can't handle them.  Everyone thinks we
  should teach children how to program, but undergraduate courses on
  computing education are practically nonexistent.  This talk will
  explore what these gaps in our books, tools, and courses tell us
  about the state of computing today, and about what it could look
  like tomorrow.

<dt>An undergraduate course in empirical software engineering</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    <a href="http://third-bit.com/2014/10/02/a-better-software-engineering-course.html">This post</a> describes the idea,
    and <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/11/29/exaptation.html">this one</a> explains why the time is right.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>Teach programmers how to run grassroots programming groups</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Creating a conventional undergraduate course on CS education similar to those on math and physics education is part of this.
    The other part is to build on the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training">Software Carpentry instructor training course</a>
    to teach people with tech skills about teaching and community organization.

  <p>
    Allow people to create synchronized voiceovers for HTML slideshows.
    The hard part is the authoring toolâ€¦
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discussion-Book-Great-People-Talking/dp/1119049717/"><em>The Discussion Book</em></a> online</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Today's MOOC platforms use the Internet like television.
    What would they look like if they directly supported some of the techniques described in this book?
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#fh"><em>500 Lines or Less</em></a> - for science!</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Can you write a climate simulator in less than 500 lines of Python?
    What about constructing phylogenetic trees in less than 500 lines of R?
    This collection would show readers how science is turned into code across a broad range of disciplines.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><em>Close Enough for Scientific Work</em></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    A companion to <em>500 Lines or Less</em>,
    this book shows readers how to <em>test</em> simple versions of a broad range of scientific applications.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><em>A Hundred Broken Programs</em></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    In the spirit of Johnson's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GUI-Bloopers-2-0-Second-Technologies/dp/0123706432/"><em>GUI Bloopers</em></a>,
    this book teaches debugging by working through a hundred short examples,
    each showing a different kind of fault, a different method of diagnosis, or a different kind of fix.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>Re-do Stefik for Python, R, MATLAB, and Julia</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    We tried to repeat <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/2014/01/29/stefik-siebert-syntax.html">Stefik et al's study of programming language syntax</a>
    for languages commonly used in science,
    but weren't able to get enough subjects.
    I think this one's worth trying again.

    The SSI has had tremendous impact on research software engineering in the UK.
    I think it could and should be replicated in other countries.

<dt><a href="https://hapgood.us/2016/05/13/choral-explanations/">Choral explanations</a></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Just as MOOCs are mistakenly treating the Internet like television,
    Caulfield's notion of choral explanations has me thinking that
    I've been mistaken in trying to treat lesson construction as software development.
    A "lesson" platform that uses Stack Overflow as its model rather than GitHub or Wikipedia
    would be fascinating to explore.

    Jon Udell's attempt to build a calendar syndication platform wasn't really about calendars:
    it was about teaching people <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2011/01/24/seven-ways-to-think-like-the-web/">how to think like the web</a>,
    and I have yet to see a better approach.

<dt><em>The Encyclopedia of Error Handling</em></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    How do programmers detect and handle errors?
    This as-yet-unwritten catalog covers everything from type-checking during compilation
    to exception handling, rolling back transactions, and re-starting servers.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><em>Software Tools</em> for the 21st Century</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    I firmly believe that the Kernighan Trilogy
    (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/020103669X/"><em>Software Tools</em></a>,
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unix-Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/013937681X/"><em>The Unix Programming Environment</em></a>,
    and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/"><em>The C Programming Language</em></a>)
    are the real reason that Unix succeeded.
    I would really like an update that uses a modern operating system and a modern programming language (preferably functional)
    and borrows heavily from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell">PowerShell</a> and the like.

    Your graduate degree is in ecology,
    but now you're running a three-person team responsible for building and maintaining a hundred thousand lines of code?
    This book (or course, or whatever) is everything you absolutely, positively need to know
    <em>after</em> you know how to program.
    (We've <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/managing-research-software-projects/short/">started work</a> on this,
    but more hands would be welcome.)

<dt>Temporal cluster analysis to find <em>actual</em> design patterns</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    I often use Sajaniemi et al's <a href="http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~saja/var_roles/stud_vers/stud_Python3_eng.html">roles of variables</a> in teaching,
    but recognize that they were "discovered" by eyeballing novice code.
    I think that cluster analysis of patterns of class and variable use would uncover more patterns.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><em>The Undergraduate Owner's Manual</em></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    I would really like to run a one-semester course for first-year undergraduates whose subject was themselves.
    What happens in your brain when you learn something, and how can you learn more efficiently?
    What's the effect of sleep deprivation on the quality of work?
    How can you analyze the social dynamics of a classroom, or change them to make participation fairer?
    How can you run a small group project?
    Who decides what gets taught at universities and who gets to take part?
