From Novice to Competent
- People go through a more-or-less predictable set of transitions from novice to competent practitioner to expert.
  - A novice does not yet have a usable mental model of the problem domain.
  - A competent practitioner has such a model.
  - Address experts later.
- The goal when teaching a novice is not to give her information,
  but to help her construct a mental model so that she has somewhere to put information.
- The key to doing this is to clear up misconceptions.
  - Use formative assessments with diagnostic power to identify and correct misconceptions while learning is taking place (every 5-10 minutes).
  - Which means quality of instruction depends on quality of correction (feedback in SCTs) as much as quality of explanation.
  - Formative assessment also allows learners to practice skills and gauge progress.

From Competent to Expert
- Knowledge isn't stored as a graph, but it's a useful metaphor.
- Expert's graph isn't just larger: it's also much more densely connected.
  - Where a competent practitioner has to search, an expert can "see" the solution in a single step.
- Expertise only emerges through *reflective practice*
  - Most people drive for 10,000 hours without becoming expert drivers…
- Sometimes use *concept maps* to represent and communicate understanding.

Cognitive Load
- Human memory consists of long-term memory (permanent storage) and short-term memory (working set).
  - Instruction loads new information into short-term memory; reinforcement keeps it there long enough for it to be transferred to long-term memory.
  - Short-term memory is very small (7±2 items), so lots of small exercises are more effective for novices than a small number of large exercises.
  - Larger exercises are more effective for more advanced learners because they are trying to master high-level skills.
- Good teaching loads (but doesn't overload) the learner's short-term memory, then reinforces long enough for knowledge to *transfer* to long-term memory.
- Effective lessons focus on one aspect of a problem at a time to reduce cognitive load.
  - Making choice of strategy, subgoals, and connections between concepts explicit helps us gauge cognitive load.

Lesson Design
1. Brainstorming
   - FIXME: Fink
   - You may not need to answer every question for every course,
     and you will often have questions or issues we haven't suggested,
     but couple of hours of thinking at this stage can save days of rework later on.
   - Checkin: a rough scope for the course that you have agreed with your CL.
2. Who is this course for?
   - "Beginner" and "expert" mean different things to different people,
     and many factors besides pre-existing knowledge influence who a course is suitable for.
   - Learner personas
   - Decide who you're helping and
     what *they* think they'll get out of it (i.e., what they'd Google for)
   - Make notes about specific prerequisite skills or knowledge you expect students to have
   - Checkin: brief summaries of who your course will help and how.
3. What will learners do along the way?
   - Define content by formative and summative assessments
   - Doing this also helps uncover technical requirements
     that might otherwise not be found until uncomfortably late in the lesson development process.
   - Point-form explanation of exercise with full solution
   - Serve as another good reality check
   - Uncovers a lot of "oh, and also..."
   - 1-2 fully explained exercises plus half a dozen point-form exercise outlines
   - Checkin: exercises.
4. How are concepts connected?
   - Put exercises in logical order
   - Derive point-form course outline for the entire course from them
   - Checkin: a course outline and tool/dataset summary at the chapter/lesson level.
   - Note: common to change assessments in this stage so that they can build on each other,
     and to discover things you forgot to list earlier.
5. What will learners' first encounter with the course be?
   - Summarize everything you have created:
     - A one-paragraph description (i.e., a sales pitch to students)
     - Half a dozen learning objectives
     - A summary of prerequisites
   - Checkin: course description, learning objectives, and prerequisites.
