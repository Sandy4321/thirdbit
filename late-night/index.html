            Presented at CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost didn't come to this conference.
            When I got the invitation, I looked at it and thought, "What the hell do I have left to say?"
            You've all heard both of my jokes,
            and many of you tell my stories better than I do---or at least, more factually.
            I could talk about the history of Software Carpentry,
            and how we got to where we are today...

            ...but most of you don't have a high enough security clearance for that.
            After rambling and ranting and arguing and teaching to you and with you for so many years,
            I felt like I had nothing left,
            so I wrote an apologetic email,
            deleted it,
            wrote another,
            deleted that,
            and then said "yes" and waited for inspiration to strike.

            What happened instead is that my brother died.
            He was told last fall that he had cancer again,
            a particularly nasty kind called mesothelioma.
            On March 21st of this year he availed himself of Canada's assisted dying laws,
            and I did what I've learned to do when hard times come:
            I threw myself into a bunch of small projects so that I wouldn't slide into depression.
            My wife and I signed up for an early-morning exercise class,
            I started revising the book I'm writing about how to teach programming,
            and I sorted out the thirty-odd boxes of books sitting in my basement.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was doing that,
            I came across these two books...

            ...and I realized that I did still have something to say that you might not have heard before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of you have probably never heard of Lewis Thomas,
            but he was pretty well known back in the 70s and 80s.
            He was a doctor who wrote columns and popular science essays---sort of the Atul Gawande of his time.
            I first came across his stuff when I was a graduate student in Edinburgh
            trying to figure out who I was and what I was good for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book on the left, "The Youngest Science",
            is the story of how medicine turned itself into a science---how doctors decided as a profession
            that they were going to pay attention to research in physiology and biochemistry
            and maybe even learn a little bit about statistics.
            It's a good story,
            and while I couldn't have foreseen it at the time,
            looking back it's clear that it's had a lot of influence on how I think about what scientists ought to know about computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's the one on the right that I want to talk about now,
            or rather,
            the essay that the book takes its title from.
            Most of you are too young to remember this,
            but the early 1980s were a dark time.
            After years of grudging coexistence between the US and the Soviet Union,
            the Cold War had become hot again.
            Ronald Reagan was in the White House and determined to bring down the "evil empire" by whatever means necessary,
            even if that meant secretly selling guns to Iran so that he could buy other guns to send to murder squads in Central America.
            A new generation of nuclear missiles was deployed to West Germany,
            and the press was full of "gosh wow" stories about orbiting weapons lasers
            or maybe particle beams or railguns---the details were never quite clear.

            Through it all,
            serious men in serious suits kept telling us that it was all going to be OK,
            and that's what Thomas chose to write about.
            I usually recommend against quoting long passages verbatim when giving talks,
            but I hope you'll forgive me if I make an exception today.

            "I cannot listen to Mahler's Ninth Symphony with anything
            like the old melancholy mixed with the high pleasure I
            used to take from this music. There was a time...  when
            what I heard, especially in the final movement, was an
            open acknowledgement of death and at the same time a quiet
            celebration of the tranquility connected to the
            process..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Now I hear it differently. I cannot listen to the last
            movement... without the door-smashing intrusion of a huge
            new thought: death everywhere, the dying of everything,
            the end of humanity. The easy sadness expressed with such
            gentleness and delicacy by that repeated phrase on faded
            strings, over and over again, no longer comes to me as
            old, familiar news of the cycle of living and dying. All
            through the last notes my mind swarms with images of a
            world in which the... bombs have begun to explode, in New
            York and San Francisco, in Moscow and Leningrad, in
            Paris...Oxford and Cambridge, in Edinburgh..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "This is a bad enough thing for the people in my
            generation. We can put up with it, I suppose, since we
            must. We are moving along anyway, like it or not..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "What I cannot imagine, what I cannot put up with...is what
            it would be like to be young. How do the young stand it? How
            can they keep their sanity? If I were very young, sixteen or
            seventeen years old, I think I would begin, perhaps very
            slowly and imperceptibly, to go crazy."
          </p>
          <p>
            "If I were sixteen or seventeen years old and had to listen
            to that, or read things like that, I would want to give up
            listening and reading. I would begin thinking up new kinds
            of sounds, different from any music heard before, and I
            would be twisting and turning to rid myself of human
            language."

            I spent a lot of time in the eighties listening to the kind of music that Thomas was talking about---angry  music.
            Somehow, though the world an I got through the eighties,
            and for a while afterward,
            I thought we were both going to be OK.
            There was still a lot of needless misery and injustice everywhere you looked,
            but it really did seem as though the arc of the universe was bending toward justice.
            I really did believe that humanity was finally starting to take the golden rule seriously,
            that we were finally going to come together to fix what was broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you all know,
            it didn't turn out that way.

            This is Ruline Steininger.
            When she was born in 1913,
            women didn't have the right to vote in the United States.
            She thought she would see a woman become president.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time she died in January 2017,
            dark times had come again.
            It's only been sixteen months,
            but things that would have been unimaginable happen so often now that we're not even appalled---we're just weary.
            Despair has become a constant companion
            as we watch the cynical and the spineless compromise with racist thugs in order to give tax breaks to billionaires
            while our planet slowly burns.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as some of you may know,
            despair is the one unforgiveable sin.
            We owe it to those who fought for us,
            and to those who will inherit this world from us,
            to do something.
            The question is what and how,
            and for that,
            I would like to turn to someone else whose work I also first encountered
            during those long, dark, lonely nights in Edinburgh.

            Ike Quebec played jazz.
            He had a few hits in the 1940s,
            but between a drug problem and changes in musical taste,
            he didn't record much in the 50s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1959 and his death from lung cancer in 1963,
            he recorded four albums that I have listened to over and over again.
            They are to me what I imagine Mahler's symphonies were to Lewis Thomas:
            comforting, inspiring---they were one of the reasons I started playing the sax in my thirties,
            and they are still on every single electronic device with a headphone jack that I own.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing.
            As beautiful as his sound was,
            Ike Quebec wasn't an innovator.
            He never did anything melodically, harmonically, or rhythmically that other people hadn't done before,
            and because of that,
            he's not remembered as one of the greats.
            In jazz as in academia,
            you have to do something new in order to be a star.
            Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonius Monk, John Coltrane---if you want to be up there with them,
            it's not enough to make beautiful music that helps people get through the worst of times.
            You have to do something that no one has done before.

            I never have.
            I joke sometimes that I'm a thought scavenger, not a thought leader,
            but it's not really a joke.
            Some of the tools I teach are almost as old as me,
            and compared to some of you,
            I'm as old as dirt.
            The programming practices that go with those tools aren't new either,
            and weren't new when I learned them in the summer of 1982.
            And yeah,
            things do change...

            ...but when Brent Gorda and I started Software Carpentry in 1998,
            we made a conscious decision not to teach what our friends were most excited about
            because the old saying is right: what's oldest lasts longest.

            The same is true of our teaching methods.
            Live coding is just teaching by demonstration,
            and that's older than our species---ask any cat who has taught her kittens how to stalk a piece of string.
            The way we're organized is as old as the fight for abolition:
            a small core of paid staff to keep things rolling,
            trained volunteers around them to help those who need it,
            and an ever-growing community of people who have been helped
            from whom we recruit and train our next volunteers.
            If these were jazz tunes,
            they'd be standards.

            But the fact that something has been done before doesn't mean it isn't worth doing again.
            Some songs are worth listening to over and over again.
            Some causes are worth fighting for,
            generation after generation,
            because injustice is the world's inbox:
            if you don't tend to it every day,
            it overflows.

            So what does this have to do with all of you?
            Well,
            you are now a world-wide community of people who know each other,
            know how to work with each other,
            and care enough about helping others to donate your time and energy to a good cause.

            In short, you are what I need to carry out the next step in my secret plan for global domination.
            You see, back when all of this started,
            I just wanted to <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">teach scientists how to program</a>
            so that when they came into my office for tech support,
            I wouldn't feel like crying when I looked at their code,
            and so that they wouldn't feel that they'd wasted weeks or months doing things badly
            when nobody had ever taught them how to do those things well.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me a decade to realize that I couldn't teach scientists how to program
            unless I got universities to care about teaching---more precisely,
            unless I got the senior faculty who run universities to care as much about teaching
            as they do about journal impact factors.

            But that won't happen on its own,
            because institutional inertia is the fifth fundamental force of nature.
            If we want better research software,
            we have to change the way junior researchers are evaluated
            so that they're given credit for building good software.
            If we want open access and open data,
            we have to change the way that universities spend their money.
            If we want everyone to have a say in those changes---not just middle-aged straight white or Asian males,
            but <em>everyone</em>---then we need real change,
            the kind of change that makes those who have power very, very uncomfortable.
