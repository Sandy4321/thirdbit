            Presented at CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost didn't come to this conference.
            When the invitation arrived, I looked at it and thought, "What the hell do I have left to say?"
            You've all heard both of my jokes,
            and many of you tell my stories better than I do---or at least, more factually.
            I could talk about the history of Software Carpentry,
            and how we got to where we are today...

            After rambling and ranting and arguing and teaching to you and with you for so many years,
            I felt like I had nothing left,
            so I wrote an apologetic email,
            deleted it,
            wrote another,
            deleted that,
            and then said "yes",
            picked a title more or less at random,
            and waited for inspiration to strike.

            It wasn't until my brother died,
            in March,
            that I realized I do still have something to say that some of you haven't heard yet.
            I don't know if it's going to be inspiring or not,
            but I think it's important,
            so I hope you'll bear with me.

            For every beginning there has to be an ending,
            but we don't talk about endings much.
            There are thousands of books on Amazon about how to start a business;
            there's only a handful about how to hand one on,
            and even fewer about how to leave one gracefully.
            Sooner or later,
            you will wind up the project you're working on
            or leave your job
            or maybe get out of academia altogether to do something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the twenty years since Brent and I taught the first Software Carpentry workshop in Los Alamos,
            I have left six jobs
            and wound down about the same number of extra-curricular projects.
            If there's a mistake I could have made and didn't,
            I don't know what it was.
            If I could send email back in time,
            this is what I'd tell my younger self.

            Whatever you have left will almost certainly not be the last thing you ever do.

            write it down,
            and then move on:
            obsessing over only-ifs and might-have-beens won't help anyone.

            People who start things usually aren't good with idleness,
            and idleness tends not to be good for them,
            so when you leave,
            leave for something,

            I didn't do any these ten things as well as I should have when I left Software Carpentry,
            but this is the one I've been kicking myself for the most.
            The reason I got it wrong is that I fell back into some bad old patterns of thought.
            You see,
            academia doesn't care if something is useful---it cares if something is <em>new</em>.
            Like a lot of you,
            I internalized that in grad school without ever really questioning it.
            It's been <em>years</em> since I thought of myself as an academic,
            but I still often feel kind of embarrassed doing something that's been done before.
            I keep thinking I have to innovate.

            The truth is, I never really have.
            I joke sometimes that I'm a thought scavenger, not a thought leader,
            but it's not really a joke.
            Some of the tools I teach are almost as old as me,
            and compared to most of you,
            I'm as old as dirt.
            The teaching practices that we use with these tools aren't new either---I mean,
            live coding is just teaching by demonstration,
            and mother cats do that with their kittens
            when they teach them how to sneak up on a piece of fluff.
            And yeah,
            I do occasionally pick up something new...

            ...but for years---for decades---I measured myself
            by how much academically-digestible novelty I produced
            and found myself wanting.
            It wasn't until I got over that

            Which brings us to Ike Quebec.
            He was a jazz musician---tenor sax.
            He had a few hits in the 40s,
            but between a drug problem and changes in musical taste,
            he didn't record much in the 50s.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his last couple of years,
            though,
            he laid down four albums that I have listened to at least a couple of thousand times.
            They were one of the reasons I started playing the sax myself,
            and they are still on every single electronic device with a headphone jack that I own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ike Quebec had this big, round, beautiful sound---it's like a hug from an old friend---but he wasn't an innovator.
            He never did anything melodically, harmonically, or rhythmically that other people hadn't done before,
            and because of that,
            he's not considered one of the greats.
            In jazz as in academia,
            it's not enough to do something wonderful:
            you have to do something <em>new</em>.

            I don't have to listen to new kinds of music if I don't want to.
            I'll happily watch <em>The Mummy</em> yet again because it's a fun, dumb movie.
            And I will teach people how to break their code up into functions
            and how to organize their data into usable tables
            and how to design a multiple choice question
            because even if it isn't new to me,
            it's new to them,

            So what does this look like in practice?
            Well,
            over the past year or so,
            I've run a scaled-down one-day class on teaching based on Carpentry's instructor training
            for the staff from the Toronto Public Library,
            a couple of local companies,
            and people who volunteer with grassroots get-into-coding groups.
            The curriculum is probably familiar to all of you---novice versus competent versus expert,
            seven plus or minus two,
            motivation and demotivation,
            recording yourself in groups of three...

            ...but I've mixed in some material from the Learning Scientists
            on how to learn effectively and that's gone over really well.
            It's been a lot of fun,
            and I'm more convinced than ever that the Carpentries' biggest long-term impact
            won't be what we teach people about programming,
            but what we teach them about how to teach together.

            I'm now talking to several groups that are trying to teach people how to be safe online
            about whether our teaching methods could help them.
            I don't have to tell you that the world and the internet are a lot scarier now
            than they were two years ago.
            Just as a handful of basic coding skills can make you a more productive researcher,
            a handful of basic security practices---the digital equivalent of washing your hands before you eat
            or using a condom or keeping your shots up to date---can help you protect yourself from stalkers and trolls.

            And I recently organized a day of training on community organization for people in tech,
            and that's something I think I'm going to do more of.
            It's also something that I think some of you are going to have to start doing.

            You see,
            if you want better research software,
            you have to change the way researchers are evaluated so that they're given credit for their work.
            If you want open access,
            you have to change the way universities spend their journal subscription budgets,
            and if you want everyone to be treated fairly,
            you need people to be held accountable for their harassment and discrimination.

            In short,
            if you want things to get better,
            you can't just tell people what better looks like:
            you need to have power,
            because institutional inertia is the fifth fundamental force of nature.

            And that might seem like a hell of a leap,
            but the truth is,
            if we want research to survive,
            we're going to have to learn how to organize anyway.
            I've been a pretty vocal critic of the modern university system,
            but I still think it is one of the crown jewels of human civilization.
            There are people--more of them every day---who would tear it down
            because silencing the messenger is easier than dealing with climate change
            or because they believe that anything that can be commercialized should be.
            We've been losing ground against them for twenty years.
            If we don't fight back---if we don't organize and collaborate
            and admit to ourselves that there are sides here and we need to pick one---then
            whether or not someone uses version control will be the least of our problems.

            I said earlier that for every beginning there has to be an ending.
            That may feel like a pretty gloomy thought for a Wednesday afternoon,
            but keep in mind that every ending except the last one is a beginning as well.
            I hope that when you look back twenty years from now,
            you'll see the Carpentries as a beginning.
            I hope that you'll have taken what you learned about programming,
            about teaching,
            about working with people you've never met before but who share your belief that better is possible,
            and done something wonderful with it.
            I hope that when it's late at night and you're listening to Ike Quebec
            (or whoever you listen to)
            you'll think, "Yeah, OK, it was worth it."
