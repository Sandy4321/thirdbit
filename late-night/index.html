          Presented at CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.

          I almost didn't come to this conference.
          When I got the invitation, I looked at it and thought, "What the hell do I have left to say?"
          You've all heard both of my jokes,
          and many of you tell my stories better than I do---or at least, more factually.
          I could talk about the history of Software Carpentry,
          and how we got to where we are today...

          ...but most of you don't have a high enough security clearance for that.
          After rambling and ranting and arguing and teaching to you and with you for so many years,
          I felt like I had nothing left,
          so I wrote an apologetic email,
          deleted it,
          wrote another,
          deleted that,
          and then said "yes" and waited for inspiration to strike.

          It never did.

          What happened instead is that my brother died.
          He was told last fall that he had cancer again,
          a particularly nasty kind called mesothelioma.
          On March 21st of this year he availed himself of Canada's assisted dying laws,
          and I did what I've learned to do when hard times come:
          I threw myself into a bunch of small projects so that I wouldn't slide into depression.
          My wife and I signed up for an early-morning exercise class,
          I started revising the book I'm writing about how to teach programming,
          and I sorted out the thirty-odd boxes of books sitting in my basement.

          As I was doing that,
          I came across these two books...

          ...and I realized that I did still have something to say that you might not have heard before.

          Most of you have probably never heard of Lewis Thomas,
          but he was pretty well known back in the 70s and 80s.
          He was a doctor who wrote columns and popular science essays---sort of the Atul Gawande of his time.
          I first came across his stuff when I was a graduate student in Edinburgh
          trying to figure out who I was and what I was good for.

          The book on the left, "The Youngest Science",
          is the story of how medicine turned itself into a science---how doctors decided that
          they were going to pay attention to research in physiology and biochemistry
          and maybe even learn a little bit about statistics.
          It's a good story,
          and while I couldn't have foreseen it at the time,
          looking back it's clear that it's had a lot of influence on how I think about what scientists ought to know about computing.
