            Presented at CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost didn't come to this conference.
            When the invitation arrived, I looked at it and thought, "What the hell do I have left to say?"
            You've all heard both of my jokes,
            and many of you tell my stories better than I do---or at least, more factually.
            I could talk about the history of Software Carpentry,
            and how we got to where we are today...

          <p>
            After rambling and ranting and arguing and teaching to you and with you for so many years,
            I felt like I had nothing left,
            so I wrote an apologetic email,
            deleted it,
            wrote another,
            deleted that,
            and then said "yes",
            picked a title more or less at random,
            and waited for inspiration to strike.

          <h3>2018-12-17: write Carpentry talk.</h3>
          <h3>2018-01-01: write Carpentry talk.</h3>

            It never did.
          </p>
          <p>
            But despair is the one unforgiveable sin,
            and eventually I realized that I did still have something to say
            that some of you might not yet have heard.
            To start,
            I would like to turn to someone whose work I first encountered
            when I was in grad school in Edinburgh.

            His name was Ike Quebec, and he played jazz.
            He had a few hits in the 1940s,
            but between a drug problem and changes in musical taste,
            he didn't record much in the 50s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1959 and his death from lung cancer in 1963,
            though,
            he laid down four albums that I have listened at least a couple of thousand times.
            They are to me what Mahler's symphonies were to Lewis Thomas;
            they were one of the reasons I started playing the sax myself,
            and they are still on every single electronic device with a headphone jack that I own.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing.
            As beautiful as his sound was,
            Ike Quebec wasn't an innovator.
            He never did anything melodically, harmonically, or rhythmically that other people hadn't done before,
            and because of that,
            he's not remembered as one of the greats.
            In jazz as in academia,
            it's not enough to do something wonderful:
            you have to do something <em>new</em>.

            I never have.
            I joke sometimes that I'm a thought scavenger, not a thought leader,
            but it's not really a joke.
            Some of the tools I teach are almost as old as me,
            and compared to most of you,
            I'm as old as dirt.
            The programming practices that go with those tools aren't new either,
            and weren't when I learned them in 1982.
            And yeah,
            things do change...

            ...but our content has always been conservative.
            The same is true of our teaching methods:
            live coding,
            for example,
            is just a form of teaching by demonstration,
            and that's older than our species.

            I know that some of you are wondering what your own next steps ought to be,
            and while I expect my thinking will continue to evolve,
            this... feels right.
            When my wife and daughter are sleeping but I can't because I'm worried about the state the world is in,
            when I'm listening to Ike Quebec and thinking about how far we've come and how far we still have to go,
            this feels like the right next thing to do.
