            Presented at CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost didn't come to this conference.
            When I got the invitation, I looked at it and thought, "What the hell do I have left to say?"
            You've all heard both of my jokes,
            and many of you tell my stories better than I do---or at least, more factually.
            I could talk about the history of Software Carpentry,
            and how we got to where we are today...

            After rambling and ranting and arguing and teaching to you and with you for so many years,
            I felt like I had nothing left,
            so I wrote an apologetic email,
            deleted it,
            wrote another,
            deleted that,
            and then said "yes" and waited for inspiration to strike.

            What happened instead is that my brother was told that he had cancer again,
            a particularly nasty kind called mesothelioma.
            On March 21st of this year he availed himself of Canada's assisted dying laws,
            and I did what I've learned to do when hard times come:
            I threw myself into a bunch of small projects so that I wouldn't slide into depression.
            My wife and I signed up for an early-morning exercise class,
            I started revising the book I'm writing about how to teach programming,
            and I sorted out the thirty-odd boxes of books sitting in my basement.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was doing that,
            I came across these two books...

            ...and I realized that I did still have something to say that you might not have heard before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of you probably don't know who Lewis Thomas is,
            but he was a doctor who wrote popular science essays in the 70s and 80s.
            I first came across his stuff when I was a graduate student in Edinburgh
            trying to figure out who I was and what I was good for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book on the left, "The Youngest Science",
            is the story of how doctors decided that they were going to pay attention to research in physiology and biochemistry
            and maybe even learn a little bit about statistics.
            It's a good story,
            and while I couldn't have foreseen it at the time,
            looking back it's clear that it's had a lot of influence on how I think about what scientists ought to know about computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's the one on the right that I want to talk about now,
            or rather,
            the essay that the book takes its title from.
            Most of you are too young to remember this,
            but the early 1980s were a dark time.
            After years of grudging coexistence between the US and the Soviet Union,
            the Cold War had become hot again.
            Ronald Reagan was in the White House and determined to bring down the "evil empire" by whatever means necessary,
            even if that meant secretly selling guns to Iran so that he could buy other guns to send to murder squads in Central America.
            A new generation of nuclear missiles was deployed to West Germany,
            and the press was full of "gosh wow" stories about orbiting weapons lasers
            or maybe particle beams or railguns---the details were never quite clear.

            Through it all,
            serious men in serious suits kept telling us that it was all going to be OK,
            and that's what Thomas chose to write about.
            I recommend against quoting long passages verbatim when giving talks;
            I hope you'll forgive me if I make an exception today.

            "I cannot listen to Mahler's Ninth Symphony with anything
            like the old melancholy mixed with high pleasure I used to
            take from this music. There was a time...  when what I
            heard, especially in the final movement, was an open
            acknowledgement of death and at the same time a quiet
            celebration of the tranquility connected to the
            process..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Now I hear it differently. I cannot listen to the last
            movement... without the door-smashing intrusion of a huge
            new thought: death everywhere, the dying of everything,
            the end of humanity. The easy sadness expressed with such
            gentleness and delicacy by that repeated phrase on faded
            strings, over and over again, no longer comes to me as
            old, familiar news of the cycle of living and dying. All
            through the last notes my mind swarms with images of a
            world in which the... bombs have begun to explode."
          </p>
          <p>
            "This is a bad enough thing for the people in my
            generation. We can put up with it, I suppose, since we
            must. We are moving along anyway, like it or not..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "What I cannot imagine, what I cannot put up with...is what
            it would be like to be young. How do the young stand it? How
            can they keep their sanity? If I were very young, sixteen or
            seventeen years old, I think I would begin, perhaps very
            slowly and imperceptibly, to go crazy."
          </p>
          <p>
            "If I were sixteen or seventeen years old and had to listen
            to that, or read things like that, I would want to give up
            listening and reading. I would begin thinking up new kinds
            of sounds, different from any music heard before, and I
            would be twisting and turning to rid myself of human
            language."

            I spent a lot of time in the eighties listening to the kind of music that Thomas was talking about---angry  music.
            Somehow, though the world and I got through it,
            and for a while afterward,
            I thought we were both going to be OK.
            There was still a lot of needless misery and injustice everywhere you looked,
            but it really did seem as though the arc of the universe was bending toward justice.
            I really did believe that humanity was finally starting to take the golden rule seriously,
            that we were finally going to come together to fix what was broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you all know,
            it didn't turn out that way.

            This is Ruline Steininger.
            When she was born in 1913,
            women didn't have the right to vote in the United States.
            She thought she would live to see a woman become president.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time she died in January 2017,
            dark times had come again.
            It's only been sixteen months,
            but things that would have been unimaginable now happen so often now that we're not even appalled---we're just weary.
            Despair has become a constant companion
            as we watch the cynical and the spineless compromise with racist thugs in order to give tax breaks to billionaires
            while our planet slowly burns.
          </p>
          <p>
            But despair <em>is</em> the one unforgiveable sin.
            We owe it to those who fought for us,
            and to those who will inherit this world from us,
            to do something.
            The question is what and how,
            and for that,
            I would like to turn to someone else whose work I also first encountered
            during those long, dark, lonely nights in Edinburgh.

            Ike Quebec was a jazz sax player.
            He had a few hits in the 1940s,
            but between a drug problem and changes in musical taste,
            he didn't record much in the 50s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1959 and his death from lung cancer in 1963,
            though,
            he recorded four albums that I have listened at least a couple of thousand times.
            They are to me what Mahler's symphonies were to Lewis Thomas:
            comforting, inspiring---they were one of the reasons I started playing the sax myself,
            and they are still on every single electronic device with a headphone jack that I own.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing.
            As beautiful as his sound was,
            Ike Quebec wasn't an innovator.
            He never did anything melodically, harmonically, or rhythmically that other people hadn't done before,
            and because of that,
            he's not remembered as one of the greats.
            In jazz as in academia,
            you have to do something new in order to be a star.
            Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonius Monk, John Coltrane---if you want to be up there with them,
            it's not enough to make beautiful music that helps people get through the worst of times.
            You have to do something that no one has done before.

            I never have.
            I joke sometimes that I'm a thought scavenger, not a thought leader,
            but it's not really a joke.
            Some of the tools I teach are almost as old as me,
            and compared to most of you,
            I'm as old as dirt.
            The programming practices that go with those tools aren't new either,
            and weren't when I learned them in 1982.
            And yeah,
            things do change...

          <p>
            The same is true of our teaching methods.
            Live coding is just teaching by demonstration,
            and that's older than our species---just watch a cat teaching her kittens how to stalk a piece of string.
            What we do only <em>seems</em> new because so many of us have never been taught how to teach at all.

            Similarly,
            the way we're organized is as old as the fight for abolition:
            a small core of paid staff to keep things rolling,
            trained volunteers around them to help those who need it,
            and an ever-growing community of people who have been helped
            from whom we recruit and train our next volunteers.
            If these were jazz tunes,
            they'd be standards that everyone could hum along to.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I learned from listening to Ike Quebec is that
            the fact that something isn't new doesn't mean it isn't worth doing.
            Some songs are worth listening to over and over again.
            Some causes are worth fighting for,
            time and time again...

            If you want better teaching,
            it's not enough to teach people how to teach:
            you have to give them the resources they need to make the changes they should make.
            If you want better research software,
            you have to change the way researchers are evaluated
            so that they're given credit for building good software.
            If you want open access,
            you have to change the way universities spend their journal subscription budgets.

            The good news is that organizing for structural change is as teachable a skill as programming or teaching.

            ...and I recently ran a one-day workshop for people in Toronto's tech community
            who wanted to learn how to organize for community change.
            The devil is always in the details,
            but I'm convinced that the Carpentry model---what I'm going to call a teaching commons---will work
            for more than just programming.

            And yes, I said "just", but in this case I think it's appropriate.
            In the grand scheme of things,
            teaching people version control is just a training ground.
            Making sure that everyone has a voice regardless of their sex, their race, their orientation,
            or the size of their alma mater's endowment---that's a much bigger deal.

            The good news is, we don't have to do this alone.
            If you had told me ten years ago that the academy would be talking about
            sexual harassment,
            racial discrimination,
            and the exploitation of adjuncts and other untenured staff,
            and actually, maybe, finally, trying to do something about them,
            I wouldn't have believed you.
            I think that we can <em>and should</em> contribute what we know about teaching together
            to those larger and more important efforts.

            This brings me back to the idea of a teaching commons.
            The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
            Equally,
            the greatest con of neoliberal capitalism has been to convince the world that no other model is viable,
            but that claim is provably untrue.
            Elinor Ostrom and others have kept alive the idea of a commons:
            something managed jointly by a community according to rules they themselves have evolved and adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Carpentries are proof by implementation that a teaching commons is possible---that
            a widely-distributed group of people can build, maintain, and deliver high-quality lessons
            in a sustainable way and for the greater good.
            The longer I'm out here looking in,
            the more remarkable that seems,
            and the more I believe that the Carpentries' biggest long-term impact
            won't be what we teach people about programming,
            but what we are discovering about how to teach together.

            I learned a lot from this little book about how to figure out what you're trying to say
            and how to get people to listen.
            When it comes to climate change, vaccination, discrimination, or open access publishing,
            we have all the evidence we need:
            what we're failing at is changing minds.
            We need to learn how to do that if we're going to get the stuff we already teach entrenched in the curriculum;
            if we're going to master that skill anyway,
            we might as well use it for something bigger.

            I know there are people in the room today who have been stalked and harassed;
            given half a day,
            we could teach people the digital equivalent of washing your hands before eating,
            using a condom,
            and making sure your kids are immunized.
            And yes,

            but I've been talking to people who do,

            It isn't my place any longer to say what the Carpentries ought to do next.
            That job belongs to Tracy and her team,
            and they're doing it a lot better than I ever did.
            (For a start, most of their stories actually are true...)
            What I'm trying to do these days is figure out what it all meant and what it was all for,
            which, when you come right down to it,
            pretty much sums up the human condition.

            I expect I'll change my thinking in the months to come,
            but... this feels right.
            When my wife and daughter are sleeping but I can't,
            when I'm listening to Ike Quebec
            and thinking about how far we've come and how far we still have to go.
            this feels right.
            I expect I'll look back in ten years and wish I'd thought it through a little more carefully,
            but as Emily Jane McTavish once said,
            the mistakes <em>are</em> the lesson.
