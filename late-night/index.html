            Presented at CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost didn't come to this conference.
            When the invitation arrived, I looked at it and thought, "What the hell do I have left to say?"
            You've all heard both of my jokes,
            and many of you tell my stories better than I do---or at least, more factually.
            I could talk about the history of Software Carpentry,
            and how we got to where we are today...

            After rambling and ranting and arguing and teaching to you and with you for so many years,
            I felt like I had nothing left,
            so I wrote an apologetic email,
            deleted it,
            wrote another,
            deleted that,
            and then said "yes",
            picked a title more or less at random,
            and waited for inspiration to strike.

            What happened instead is that my brother died of cancer,
            and I did what I've learned to do when hard times come to stop myself from sliding into depression:
            I threw myself into a bunch of little projects to stay busy.
            My wife and I signed up for an early-morning exercise class,
            I started revising my book on how to teach programming,
            and I sorted out the thirty-odd boxes of books sitting in my basement.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was doing that,
            I came across these...

            ...and I realized that I did still have something to say that you might not have heard before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lewis Thomas was a doctor who wrote popular science essays in the 70s and 80s.
            I first came across his stuff when I was a graduate student in Edinburgh
            trying to figure out who I was and what I was good for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book on the left is the story of how doctors decided that they were going to pay attention to research in physiology and biochemistry
            and maybe even learn a little bit about statistics.
            It's a good story,
            and looking back,
            it's had a lot of influence on how I think about getting scientists to adopt better computing practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's the title essay of the one on the right that I want to talk about now.
            Most of you are too young to remember this,
            but the early 1980s were a dark time.
            After years of grudging coexistence,
            the US and the Soviet Union were eyeball to eyeball once again.
            Ronald Reagan was in the White House,
            and he was determined to bring down the "evil empire" by whatever means necessary,
            even if that meant secretly selling guns to Iran so that he could support murder squads in Central America.
            A new generation of nuclear missiles was deployed to West Germany,
            and the press was full of "gosh wow" stories about orbiting weapons lasers
            or maybe particle beams or railguns---the details were never quite clear.

            Through it all,
            serious men in suits kept talking calmly about whether a hundred million dead on our side
            versus two hundred million dead on theirs
            would count as a victory or not.
            Now, I usually recommend against quoting long passages verbatim when giving talks,
            but I hope you'll forgive me if I make an exception today for part of Thomas's essay.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I cannot listen to Mahler's Ninth Symphony with anything
            like the... pleasure I used to take from this music. There
            was a time...  when what I heard, especially in the final
            movement, was an open acknowledgement of death and at the
            same time a quiet celebration of the tranquility connected
            to the process..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Now I hear it differently. I cannot listen to the last
            movement... without the door-smashing intrusion of a huge
            new thought: death everywhere, the dying of everything,
            the end of humanity. The easy sadness expressed with such
            gentleness and delicacy by that repeated phrase on faded
            strings, over and over again, no longer comes to me as
            old, familiar news of the cycle of living and dying. All
            through the last notes my mind swarms with images of a
            world in which the... bombs have begun to explode."
          </p>
          <p>
            "This is a bad enough thing for the people in my
            generation. We can put up with it, I suppose, since we
            must. We are moving along anyway, like it or not..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "What I cannot imagine...is what it would be like to be
            young. How do the young stand it? How can they keep their
            sanity? If I were...sixteen or seventeen years old, I
            think I would begin, perhaps very slowly and
            imperceptibly, to go crazy."
          </p>
          <p>
            "If I were sixteen or seventeen years old...I would want
            to give up listening and reading. I would begin thinking
            up new kinds of sounds, different from any music heard
            before, and I would be twisting and turning to rid myself
            of human language."

            And here are some other pictures that are even better,
            because as you all know, the war that Thomas feared didn't come.
            The Wall came down,
            a black man became president,
            people could marry who they loved---sure,
            there was still a lot of needless misery and injustice everywhere you looked,
            but it really did seem as though the arc of the universe was bending toward justice.
            I really did believe that humanity was finally starting to take the golden rule seriously,
            that we were finally going to come together to fix what was broken.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you all know,
            it didn't turn out that way.

            This is Ruline Steininger.
            When she was born in 1913,
            women didn't have the right to vote in the United States.
            At the age of 103,
            she thought she going to see a woman become president.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead,
            what she saw was the dark times come again.
            Things that would have been unimaginable just a couple of years ago
            now happen so often now that we're not even appalled---we're just weary.
            Despair has become a constant companion
            as we watch the cynical and the spineless compromise with racist thugs in order to give tax breaks to billionaires
            while our planet slowly burns.
          </p>
          <p>
            But despair is the one unforgiveable sin.
            We owe it to those who fought for us,
            and to those who will inherit this world from us,
            to do something.
            The question is what and how,
            and for that,
            I would like to turn to someone else whose work I also first encountered
            during those long, dark, lonely nights in Edinburgh.

            His name was Ike Quebec, and he played jazz.
            He had a few hits in the 1940s,
            but between a drug problem and changes in musical taste,
            he didn't record much in the 50s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1959 and his death from lung cancer in 1963,
            though,
            he laid down four albums that I have listened at least a couple of thousand times.
            They are to me what Mahler's symphonies were to Lewis Thomas;
            they were one of the reasons I started playing the sax myself,
            and they are still on every single electronic device with a headphone jack that I own.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing.
            As beautiful as his sound was,
            Ike Quebec wasn't an innovator.
            He never did anything melodically, harmonically, or rhythmically that other people hadn't done before,
            and because of that,
            he's not remembered as one of the greats.
            In jazz as in academia,
            it's not enough to do something wonderful:
            you have to do something <em>new</em>.

            I joke sometimes that I'm a thought scavenger, not a thought leader,
            but it's not really a joke.
            Some of the tools I teach are almost as old as me,
            and compared to most of you,
            I'm as old as dirt.
            The programming practices that go with those tools aren't new either,
            and weren't when I learned them in 1982.
            And yeah,

            The way we're organized is old too---at least as old as the fight for abolition.
            A small core of paid staff to keep things rolling,
            trained volunteers around them to help those who need it,
            and an ever-growing community of people who have been helped
            from whom we recruit and train our next volunteers---if these were jazz tunes,
            they'd be standards that everyone could hum along to.

            Back when all of this started,
            I just wanted to teach scientists how to program
            so that I could actually help them when they came into my office looking for tech support.

            What I have realized over the last twenty years is that I can't reach enough scientists to matter
            working within the system we have today.
            You can't teach people how to code <em>in the time you and they have</em> without using better teaching methods.
            They can't afford to adopt better teaching methods unless they're actually rewarded for teaching well.
            They won't be rewarded for doing that unless we change the way researchers are evaluated,
            and we can't do that without making serious structural changes to the system we're in.

            The same is true for all of the things we care about.
            If you want better research software,
            you have to change the way researchers are evaluated
            so that they're given credit for their work.
            If you want open access,
            you have to change the way universities spend their journal subscription budgets.
            In short,
            if you want things to get better,
            you need power,
            because institutional inertia is the fifth fundamental force of nature.

            The good news is that getting power and using it for good is just another skill like programming or teaching.
            Some of us took part in a study group last year based on this book,
            and I recently put together a one-day workshop on community organization for people in Toronto's tech community.
            These trial runs and others have convinced me that a lot more is possible than I used to think.

            The bad news is that the idea of change---real, structural change---makes many people in academia very uncomfortable,
            even those who would benefit from it.
            Like many downtrodden people throughout history,
            grad students, adjuncts, and junior faculty will put up with being kicked by a cow
            so long as there's even a slim chance of it giving milk.
            How can we reach them?

            The answer lies in our instructor training.
            We tell people to teach something useful first,
            even if it's something small,
            in order to hook the learner's interest and build their confidence in the instructor.
            Over the past sixteen months,
            I've taught a stripped-down one-day version of our instructor training to staff at Toronto Public Library,
            volunteers with various get-into-coding groups,
            and developers at a couple of companies.
            They have gobbled it up like hungry puppies.

            This brings me to the idea of a teaching commons.
            The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
            Equally,
            the greatest trick of neoliberal capitalism has been to convince people that no other model is viable,
            but that claim is provably untrue.
            One well-studied alternative is a commons:
            a shared resource that's managed jointly by a community according to rules that they themselves have evolved.
            It can be a patch of grazing land,
            parking rights on a Boston side street,
            or a back hoe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Carpentries are proof by implementation that a teaching commons is possible---that
            a widely-distributed group of people can build, maintain, and deliver high-quality lessons
            in a structured, sustainable way for the greater good.
            The longer I'm out here looking in,
            the more remarkable that seems,
            and the more I believe that the Carpentries' biggest long-term impact
            won't be what we teach people about programming,
            but what we teach them about how to teach together.

            But as Dan Willingham says,
            you can't teach people to think without giving them something to think about,
            so how about training scientists how to market their ideas?
            I learned a lot from this little book about figuring out what you're trying to say
            and getting people to listen.
            When it comes to climate change, vaccination, nuclear power, or a host of other topics,
            we have all the answers we need:
            what we're failing to do is reach people.
            We need to learn how to do that if we're going to get stuff like version control entrenched in the curriculum;
            if we're going to master that skill anyway,
            we might as well think about passing it on to people who might use it for something bigger.

            Or how about teaching our colleagues how to be safe online?
            I know there are people in the room today who have been stalked and harassed;
            given half a day,
            friends of mine could teach you the digital equivalent of washing your hands before eating,
            using a condom,
            and making sure that your shots are up to date.
            And yes,
            I realize that most of you don't know enough about this to teach it---yet---but
            I think we could help the people who do,
            do it better.

            Or if we <em>really</em> want to change the world,

            I honestly can't think of anything that would make the average professor's life better.

            It isn't my place to say what the Carpentries organization ought to do next.
            That job belongs to Tracy and her team,
            and I think they're doing a great job.
            (For a start, most of their stories actually are true...)
            But I know that some of you are wondering what your own next steps ought to be,
            and while I expect my thinking will continue to evolve,
            this... feels right.
            When my wife and daughter are sleeping but I can't because I'm worried about the state the world is in,
            when I'm listening to Ike Quebec and thinking about how far we've come and how far we still have to go,
            this feels like the right next thing to do.
