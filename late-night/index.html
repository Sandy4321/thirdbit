            Presented at CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            I almost didn't come to this conference.
            When the invitation arrived, I looked at it and thought, "What the hell do I have left to say?"
            You've all heard both of my jokes,
            and many of you tell my stories better than I do---or at least, more factually.
            I could talk about the history of Software Carpentry,
            and how we got to where we are today...

            After rambling and ranting and arguing and teaching to you and with you for so many years,
            I felt like I had nothing left,
            so I wrote an apologetic email,
            deleted it,
            wrote another,
            deleted that,
            and then said "yes",
            picked a title more or less at random,
            and waited for inspiration to strike.

            His name was Ike Quebec, and he played jazz.
            He had a few hits in the 1940s,
            but between a drug problem and changes in musical taste,
            he didn't record much in the 50s.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his last couple of years,
            though,
            he laid down four albums that I have listened to at least a couple of thousand times.
            They were one of the reasons I started playing the sax myself,
            and they are still on every single electronic device with a headphone jack that I own.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing.
            As beautiful as his sound was,
            Ike Quebec wasn't an innovator.
            He never did anything melodically, harmonically, or rhythmically that other people hadn't done before,
            and because of that,
            he's not remembered as one of the greats.
            In jazz as in academia,
            it's not enough to do something wonderful:
            you have to do something <em>new</em>.

            I never have.
            I joke sometimes that I'm a thought scavenger, not a thought leader,
            but it's not really a joke.
            Some of the tools I teach are almost as old as me,
            and compared to most of you,
            I'm as old as dirt.
            The programming practices that go with those tools aren't new either,
            and weren't when I learned them in 1982.
            And yeah,
            I do occasionally pick up something new...

            ...but for years---for decades---I measured myself
            by how much academically-digestible novelty I produced
            and found myself wanting.
            It wasn't until I got over that
            that I was able to give myself permission to do something that was actually useful.

            And I realized,
            as I was listening to Ike Quebec in a hotel room north of Montreal
            on the night my brother died,
            that the most useful thing I could tell you all
            is what I've learned in the last couple of years about endings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sooner or later,
            you will wind up the project you're working on
            or leave your job
            or maybe get out of academia altogether to do something else like I did.
            For every beginning there has to be an ending,
            but we talk about them much less.
            There are thousands of books on Amazon about how to start a business;
            there's only a handful about how to hand one on,
            and even fewer about how to leave one gracefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the twenty years since Brent and I taught the first Software Carpentry workshop in Los Alamos,
            I have left six jobs
            and wound down about the same number of extra-curricular projects.
            If there's a mistake I could have made and didn't,
            I don't know what it was.
            If I could send email back in time,
            this is what I'd tell my younger self.

            I didn't do any these as well as I'd have liked when I left Software Carpentry.
            The one I've been trying hardest to remedy since is number four.
            Over the past year or so,
            I've run a scaled-down one-day class on teaching based on Carpentry's instructor training
            for the staff from the Toronto Public Library,
            a couple of local companies,
            and people who volunteer with grassroots get-into-coding groups.

            It's been a lot of fun,
            and I'm more convinced than ever that the Carpentries' biggest long-term impact
            won't be what we teach people about programming,
            but what we teach them about how to teach together.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing.
            It's been <em>years</em> since I thought of myself as an academic,
            but I still felt kind of embarrassed about doing the same thing again even if it's useful.
            I still feel like I'm supposed to be doing something new.
            Whenever that happens,
            I put on Ike Quebec and remind myself that a song doesn't have to be new to be beautiful.
            His music wasn't new when I first heard it in the eighties,
            but it was new to me.
            What I'm teaching now isn't new,
            but it's new to my audience,
            and helpful,
            and that's what matters.

            I said earlier that for every beginning there has to be an ending.
            That may feel like a pretty gloomy thought for a Wednesday afternoon,
            but keep in mind that every ending except the last one is a beginning as well.
