<h4><a href="{{site.github.url}}/lessons-learned/">Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned</a></h4>

<p>
  Since its start in 1998, Software Carpentry has evolved from a
  week-long training course at the US national laboratories into a
  worldwide volunteer effort to improve researchers' computing
  skills. This talk will explore the lessons we've learned along the
  way about applying open source software development techniques to
  teaching at scale, and about getting people and institutions to
  change the way they work.

<p>
  Hundreds of books about writing compilers are currently on the
  market, but there are only three about writing debuggers.
  Spreadsheets are used to do calculations more often than every other
  kind of tool combined, but thirty-five years after their invention,
  version control systems still can't handle them.  Everyone thinks we
  should teach children how to program, but undergraduate courses on
  computing education are practically nonexistent.  This talk will
  explore what these gaps in our books, tools, and courses tell us
  about the state of computing today, and about what it could look
  like tomorrow.
