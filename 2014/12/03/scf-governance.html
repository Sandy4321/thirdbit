              <h1><a href="/2014/12/03/scf-governance.html">Dec 3, 2014 - Software Carpentry Foundation: Governance</a></h1>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>
  I am pleased to announce that
  <a href="/blog/2014/10/announcing-the-creation-of-the-software-carpentry-foundational.html">our interim Steering Committee</a>
  has adopted bylaws for the Software Carpentry Foundation,
  which is the final step in us becoming an independent organization.
  The authoritative version is stored in
  <a href="/board">this public GitHub repository</a>,
  along with other key documents that will be outlined in the next couple of blog posts.
  In brief,
  the SCF has four parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the <em>Membership</em>,
    which includes active instructors and others contributing directly to the project;
  </li>
  <li>
    the <em>Steering Committee</em>,
    which is elected by and from the membership and is the SCF's primary decision-making body;
  </li>
  <li>
    the <em>Advisory Council</em>,
    which includes representatives from our major partners,
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    the <em>Executive Director</em>,
    who is an employee of the SCF responsible for overseeing its daily operations.
    The Executive Director answers to the Steering Committee,
    but is not a member of it.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have accepted the position of interim Executive Director,
  and the first elections for the Steering Committee will be held early in 2015.
  These bylaws,
  and the agreement with <a href="http://numfocus.org">NumFOCUS</a>
  that enables us to operate as a 501(c)3 non-profit,
  are the structure we need to run a successful independent foundation.
</p>
<p>
  The next priority is fundraising:
  I've been without a salary since my contract with Mozilla ended in October,
  which <a href="/blog/2014/11/where-the-time-goes.html">clearly isn't sustainable</a>.
  The <a href="/blog/2014/12/scf-membership.html">next post in this series</a> describes
  the different ways in which organizations can support us;
  we're close to signing deals with several groups,
  so I'm confident we'll start the new year with our finances in order.
