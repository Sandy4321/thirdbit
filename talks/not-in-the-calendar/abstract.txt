Hundreds of books about writing compilers are currently on the market,
but there are only three about writing debuggers. Spreadsheets are
used to do calculations more often than every other kind of tool
combined, but thirty-five years after their invention, version control
systems still can't handle them.  Everyone thinks we should teach
children how to program, but undergraduate courses on computing
education are practically nonexistent.  This talk will explore what
these gaps in our books, tools, and courses tell us about the state of
computing today, and about what it could look like tomorrow.
