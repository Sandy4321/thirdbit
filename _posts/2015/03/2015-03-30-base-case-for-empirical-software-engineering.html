  I've been

  that programmers ought to pay more attention
  to empirical studies of software engineering
  and base their practices on evidence rather than strong opinion.
  I was challenged on this yesterday when someone asked me to cite studies showing that
  a bug tracker is a better way to manage backlog than a shared spreadsheet.
  I couldn't,
  and still can't.
</p>
<p>
  I also can't find any studies showing that
  version control is a better way to manage software projects than mailing files around
  or dumping them in a shared folder.
  I "know" it's true&mdash;I wouldn't work on a project
  that didn't use version control&mdash;but then again,
  my aunt "knew" that putting colored crystals on her chi points would relieve her arthritis.
  As far as I can tell from outside the Great Paywall of Academia,
  nobody's ever actually done the study.
</p>
<p>
  That's kind of embarrassing,
  but it's also an opportunity.
  The biggest open problem in empirical software engineering research is measuring productivity:
  lines of code per hour and story points per sprint are easy but meaningless,
  and we haven't agreed on anything more sophisticated.
</p>
<p>
  So here's my proposal:
  let's use version control as a filter for measures of programmer productivity.
  If metric X doesn't show that groups using version control outperform groups that don't,
  I think we can safely discard it.
  More usefully,
  <em>how</em> different metrics measure those groups' productivity differences
  would allow us to compare those metrics more directly.
  It would also be a good starter exercise for the better software engineering course
  I've been <a href="/2014/10/02/a-better-software-engineering-course.html">musing about</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Just a thought...
