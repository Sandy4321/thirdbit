Sylvia Jane Cotton (n&eacute;e Wilson), November 7, 1964 &ndash; January 21, 2012

<em>I have sometimes dreamt that when the Day of Judgment dawns and great conquerors and lawyers and statesmen come to receive their rewards&mdash;their crowns, their laurels, their names carved indelibly upon imperishable marble&mdash;the Almighty will turn to Peter and will say, not without a certain envy when He sees us coming with our books under our arms, "Look, these need no reward. We have nothing to give them. They have loved reading."
&mdash; Virginia Woolf</em>
