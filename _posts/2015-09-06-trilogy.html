  Every few years,
  I indulge in a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_magic">sympathetic magic</a>
  by writing reviews of books that don't actually exist
  in the hope that it will inspire someone to write them.
  Previous versions written in
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/not-on-the-shelves-1997.html">1997</a>,
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/not-on-the-shelves-2003.html">2003</a>,
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/not-on-the-shelves-2009.html">2009</a>,
  and <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/not-on-the-shelves-2014.html">2014</a>
  led to
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>,
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/"><em>Making Software</em></a>,
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/index.html"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>,
  and most recently <em>500 Lines or Less</em>,
  which is <a href="http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/">now in early release</a>.

  Writing these wish lists has helped me figure out what I think our field needs
  and how best I could contribute to it.
