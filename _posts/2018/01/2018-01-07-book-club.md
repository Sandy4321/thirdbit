I started as a programmer,
but somehow became a teacher.
If I wanted to make that transition today faster and with fewer false starts,
I would read these books in this order:

1.  Either Lang's *[Small Teaching](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Teaching-Everyday-Lessons-Learning/dp/1118944496/)*
    or Huston's *[Teaching What You Don't Know](https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-What-You-Dont-Know/dp/0674035801/)*.
    These are both short, approachable, and connect things you can do right now back to the research that backs them.

2.  Both Major et al's *[Teaching for Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Learning-Intentionally-Educational-Activities/dp/0415699363/)*
    and Brookfield and Preskill's *[The Discussion Book](https://www.amazon.com/Discussion-Book-Great-People-Talking/dp/1119049717/)*.
    The first catalogs a hundred different kinds of exercises you can do with students;
    the second describes fifty different ways that groups can discuss things productively.
    (These books can be used on their own,
    but I think they'll make more sense once Huston or Lang have given you a framework for understanding them.)

3.  Both Green's *[Building a Better Teacher](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393351084/)*
    and McMillan Cottom's *[Lower Ed](https://www.amazon.com/Lower-Ed-Troubling-Profit-Colleges/dp/1620970600/)*.
    Learning never happens in a vacuum;
    as a start on understanding the broader context,
    these two short books explain why so many attempts at educational reform have failed over the past forty years
    and how for-profit colleges are exploiting and exacerbating the growing inequality in our society.

4.  Possibly Guzdial's *[Learner-Centered Design of Computing Education](https://www.amazon.com/Learner-Centered-Design-Computing-Education-Human-centered/dp/1627053514/)*
    and Hazzan et al's *[Guide to Teaching Computer Science](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Teaching-Computer-Science-Activity-Based/dp/1447166299/)*.
    These are the two most useful academic books I've found about teaching computing;
    your mileage may vary.

5.  Both Papert's *[Mindstorms](https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746/)*
    and Watters' *[The Monsters of Education Technology](http://monsters.hackeducation.com/)*.
    The first presents an inspiring vision of how computers could change education;
    the second is a collection of talks describing and critiquing what we've done instead.

6.  Brown's *[Building Powerful Community Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Powerful-Community-Organizations-Personal/dp/0977151808/)*,
    because you'll eventually realize that you can't teach computing without changing the system,
    and you can't change the system without mobilizing people.

While working through these, I would also subscribe to:

*   [Mark Guzdial's blog](https://computinged.wordpress.com/),
    which is the single most useful source of information about computing education I've ever found.

*   [The Learning Scientists](http://www.learningscientists.org/),
    which is just as useful,
    and covers evidence-based teaching in general.

If you're working in a formal classroom seting,
I would also take an occasional look at
[SIGCSE](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/events/symposia),
[ITiCSE](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/events/iticse),
and [ICER](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/events/icer),
which are three academic conferences about computing education.
(Unfortunately,
many of their papers are behind paywalls
that make them inaccessible to the general public,
and I don't know of equivalent gatherings for people working in free-range settings like coding bootcamps or weekend coding clubs.)
Finally,
I might eventually dive into Ambrose et al's *[How Learning Works](https://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101/)*
and Wlodkowski and Ginsberg's *[Enhancing Adult Motivation to Learn](https://www.amazon.com/Enhancing-Adult-Motivation-Learn-Comprehensive/dp/1119077990/)*,
which are both dense summaries of learning research.

There are thousands of books about all aspects of education;
what would you add to this list,
and what would you take out to make room?
And what's your favorite book about teaching online?
Comments or feedback would be very welcome.
