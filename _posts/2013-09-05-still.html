<p>
  I am pleased to announce that my YA novelette <cite>Still</cite>
  is <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/greg-wilson/still/paperback/product-21191591.html">now available</a>
  at Lulu.com
  (and shortly at Amazon.com and elsewhere).
  The story is an extended version of one that ran in
  the <a href="http://www.onspec.ca/node/143">Summer 2010 edition of <cite>OnSpec</cite> magazine</a>.
  The book deals with some difficult themes,
  but it's the piece of writing I'm proudest of.
  I hope you enjoy it.
