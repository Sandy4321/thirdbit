As I <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/882.html">mentioned</a> a few weeks ago, we're putting together some new software engineering courses at the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu">University of Toronto</a>.  I'd be very interested in hearing from former 49X students: looking back, what did you learn from doing your project?  What did you find valuable in the course, and what was just plain wrongheaded?

<em>Later: Olivier Yiptong decided to provide feedback in the form of a <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/img/csc49x-feedback-mindmap.png">mindmap</a>---another first for this particular blog ;-)</em>
