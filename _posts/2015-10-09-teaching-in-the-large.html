  Acccording to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small">Wikipedia</a>,
  the terms "programming in the large" and "programming in the small"
  were coined by Frank DeRemer and Hans Kron in 1975
  to describe two very different approaches to creating software.
  Programming in the small is where everyone starts and most people remain:
  with code that is small enough for one person to understand.
  By contrast,
  programming in the large describes the construction of
  systems that need to be engineered as collections of subsystems.
</p>
<p>
  It's tempting to say that programming in the small is a craft,
  where programming in the large is engineering.
  In my experience,
  though,
  that distinction is inaccurate because it doesn't take cognitive hysteresis into account.
  Many of the programmers I know have actually gone through three phases.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      They learn craft practices by building small programs on their own or in school.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      They learn engineering practices by helping to build larger programs
      in work terms or jobs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      They then apply some of those engineering practices to small-scale jobs
      because they work better than the craft practices they supplant.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  For example,
  I use version control and repeatable testing on small projects,
  but learned them on large ones and then scaled them down.
  When I teach them in <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>,
  I'm effectively trying to convince researchers to go straight from stage 1 to stage 3
  without personal experience of stage 2.
</p>
<p>
  Whether that can be done,
  and if so how to do it,
  are interesting questions.
  What I want to do now, though, is make an analogy with teaching.
  Almost all teachers create almost all of their own lessons.
  They don't work together in dozens or hundreds to co-create and share material,
  so they have never developed the equivalent of engineering practices for lesson development.
  They're all teaching in the small rather than teaching in the large;
  they're stuck in stage 1 without a stage 2 to go to,
  so they can't ever reach stage 3.
</p>
<p>
  This analogy is flawed,
  but it has given me a new way to think about what I've learned about teaching
  over the past five and a half years.
  For a start,
  most MOOCs and open educational resource (OER) projects aren't teaching in the large:
  they are teaching in the small amplified by the internet to reach more people.
  I know I'm not objective,
  but Software Carpentry's collaborative lesson development process feels different:
  dozens of people can <em>and do</em> make lots of incremental contributions,
  while more than fifty have now told us what they actually do when they teach those lessons.
  I don't know if that's teaching in the large or not,
  but it is starting to seem qualitatively different from what I've done before.
  What I'd like to do next is scale it up tenfold to see what other new practices emerge,
  and whether we might then be able to take some of them back to sole practitioners.
