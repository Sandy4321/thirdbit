  I had the pleasure of meeting Denia Djokic on Tuesday evening,
  and during the conversation we came up with a modest proposal:
  put 10% of the national budget for scientific research in a special fund,
  and have high school students vote on how to allocate it.
  It would give scientists a powerful reason to communicate more clearly about their research,
  give young people a way to direct research toward things that are going to affect them,
  and would probably be no worse than
  <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160216090128.htm">the existing system</a>.
  (And yes,
  in practice a great many students wouldn't care enough to vote,
  while others' votes would be influenced by their parents,
  but the first has neutral value,
  while the second isn't really a downside from my point of view.)

  So,
  what's wrong with this idea?
