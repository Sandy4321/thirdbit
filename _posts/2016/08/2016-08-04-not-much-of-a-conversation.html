  I've been reading articles on <a href="https://theconversation.com/us">The Conversation</a> for a while,
  and with a couple of trips coming up,
  I thought I might try to write something for them.
  I clicked on their "Become an author" link,
  and got this:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="{{site.github.url}}/img/2016/08/conversation.png" />
</p>

  My first reaction was disappointment.
  My second was that it's not much of a conversation if only one side gets to talk.
  Depending on how you count,
  only 2% to 18% of people doing doctorates become professors.
  The rest of us don't actually have our brains wiped when we leave,
  and acting as if we did doesn't exactly encourage us to stay engaged with the academy.
