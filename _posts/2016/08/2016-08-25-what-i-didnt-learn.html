title: "What I Didn't Learn in a CS Degree"

  I recently stumbled across
  <em><a href="https://bigmachine.io/imposter/">The Imposter's Handbook</a></em>,
  which describes itself this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    For the longest time I would remain silent when discussions with
    my peers would veer toward theoretical topics like P vs. NP,
    Lambda Calculus or bubble sort vs. merge sort...  I decided to
    change all of this a year ago. I sat down and looked up all of the
    topics that a typical CS degree covers and then I dove in. Half
    way through, I decided to write a book about what I was learning.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It's an interesting project,
  but it got me thinking about all the things I <em>didn't</em> learn
  when I <em>did</em> do a CS degree:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Most of what I've "accomplished" should actually be attributed
    to being born white and male without serious mental or physical challenges
    in a stable middle-class family
    living in a peaceful democracy
    at a time when we didn't yet have to acknowledge the long-term cost of our profligacy.
    In short,
    how well I played my cards is line noise compared to how lucky a hand I was dealt
    compared to 95% of my fellow human beings.
  </li>
  <li>
    The computing industry is actively unwelcoming to people who aren't straight white/Asian males,
    routinely builds systems that facilitate their harassment and abuse,
    and then <a href="https://twitter.com/mhoye/status/763955787869753344">pretends that the problem is somehow insoluble</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Equally,
    the financial-industrial complex called Silicon Valley doesn't actually want to disrupt anything that matters
    because it's quite happy with wealth and power being distributed as they are
    (i.e., unequally, but in their favor).
  </li>
  <li>
    Silicon Valley perpetuates the mythos of the rags-to-riches startup
    in order to extract as much unpaid or low-paid labor from people as it can,
    regardless of <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2015/11/09/daddy-why-dont-you-ever-laugh.html">the personal cost</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hundreds of "learn to code" groups have sprung up in the past decade,
    but most of their founders unconsciously assume that knowledge will flow one way and gratitude another:
    <em>we</em> will teach <em>them</em> Javascript and data analysis,
    and <em>they</em> will just listen.
    The fact is,
    <em>they</em> have vitally important things to teach <em>us</em>
    about running meetings, being inclusive, staying focused on things that actually matter,
    and all the other tremendously hard skills I condescendingly called "soft" when I was in my twenties.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It's easy to say "this stuff isn't part of computer science",
  but that's disingenuous:
  the boundaries of computer science are exactly where we choose to draw them,
  just like the boundaries of medicine or economics.
  Computer science can include this:
</p>
  <a href="{{site.github.url}}/img/2016/08/women-in-cs.jpg"><img src="{{site.github.url}}/img/2016/08/women-in-cs.jpg" alt="Declining Female Participation in Computing" width="400px" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  or the fact that "online education" is a code phrase for
  <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2014/03/14/learning-at-scale.html">ubiquitous surveillance in the classroom</a>,
  or anything else we choose.
</p>
<p>
  I'm looking forward to <em>The Imposter's Handbook</em>,
  but I would look forward more to a book
  that collected and presented all the "other stuff" I didn't learn in school.
  I'm not qualified to write it,
  but nothing would make me prouder than to see it as
  the next volume in the <a href="http://aosabook.org/">AOSA</a> series.
  I'd be grateful for your thoughts.
