<p>
  I'm pleased to announce that we are going to follow up
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/">this</a>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/">series</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#vol1">of</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#vol2">crowd</a>-<a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#posa">sourced</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#fh">books</a>
  with one titled
  <em>What Everyone In Tech Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Poverty, Harassment, Privacy,
    and How Our Political, Economic, and Legal Systems Actually Work</em>.
  We'll choose something shorter for publication,
  but for now it sums up our intention to produce a collection of short tutorials (3000-5000 words each)
  to introduce readers to
  <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/2016/08/26/what-i-didnt-learn.html">all those things that <em>aren't</em> included in a typical Computer Science degree</a>.
  For example,
  someone who doesn't know
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_test#Voting">how literacy tests were used to disenfranchise racial minorities</a>
  may find
  <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/the-right-to-vote-should-be-restricted-to-those-with-knowledge">idiocy like this</a>
  reasonable.
  Similarly,
  it's easier to see <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/2014/03/14/learning-at-scale.html">what's wrong with so much discussion of MOOCs</a>
  if you know a little about
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Education-Technology-Audrey-Watters/dp/1505225051/">the history of educational technology</a>
  and understand how
  <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/2012/05/24/everything-you-need-to-know-about-standardized-testing.html">standardized testing perpetuates inequality</a>.
