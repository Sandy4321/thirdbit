<p>
  If you know a little about
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Education-Technology-Audrey-Watters/dp/1505225051/">the history of educational technology</a>
  and understand how
  <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/2012/05/24/everything-you-need-to-know-about-standardized-testing.html">standardized testing perpetuates inequality</a>,
  you're more likely to see why
  <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/2014/03/14/learning-at-scale.html">introducing ubiquitous surveillance into the classroom</a>
  may be a bad idea.
  Similarly,
  once you know
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_test#Voting">how literacy tests were used to disenfranchise racial minorities</a>,
  you're less likely to be seduced by
  <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/the-right-to-vote-should-be-restricted-to-those-with-knowledge">this kind of superficially plausible idiocy</a>.
  And if engineers at Facebook knew
  <a href="http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/now/politics/216905-the-lingering-effects-of-nyc-racist-city-planning">how city planners made beaches inaccessible to public transit</a>
  so that the "wrong" people couldn't reach them,
  maybe they would have been less quick to build tools that
  <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race">let advertisers hide certain ads from specific racial groups</a>
  (sorry, "ethnic affinities").
</p>

<p>
  I'm therefore pleased to announce that we are going to follow up
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/">this</a>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/">series</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#vol1">of</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#vol2">crowd</a>-<a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#posa">sourced</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#fh">books</a>
  with one titled
  <em>What Everyone In Tech Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Poverty, Harassment, Privacy,
    and How Our Political, Economic, and Legal Systems Actually Work</em>.
  We'll probably choose something shorter for publication,
  but for now it sums up our intention to introduce readers to things that aren't included in a typical Computer Science degree,
  but which every programer really ought to be aware of.
</p>

<dl>

  <dt>
    What are you looking for?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Tutorial essays, each 2000-5000 words long.
    Tell us a bit of history,
    explain why a widely-held belief is wrong,
    or connect the dots so that people don't have to on their own.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What <em>aren't</em> you looking for?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Rants, sermons, and calls to action.
    This book's job is to inform:
    we hope that knowledge will lead to action,
    but our focus is on the first.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    But isn't all this stuff out there on the Internet already?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Sure,
    but that's like saying that Google and Stack Overflow
    mean that we don't need lessons on programming:
    a lot of people don't know where to look or what to look for,
    so providing some starting points and context can make a big difference.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What about technology?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Our focus is about the world technology acts in and on,
    rather than the technology itself.
    For example,
    our intended readers probably don't need us to explain what Tor is,
    but they probably haven't ever walked through
    the flaws in the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument">nothing to hide</a>" argument.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Why you?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Because we've had a lot of experience assembling books this way.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Why now?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    If not now, then when?
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How can I get involved?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">Mail us</a> if you'd like to contribute.
    If you know what you want to write about, tell us;
    if you don't, we have lots of topics that need to be covered.
    And don't worry if you're not yet an expert:
    so long as you're wililng to learn along the way,
    it may actually make you better at explaining your topic to people starting from the same place as you.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How else can I get involved?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We'll be looking for reviewers as well:
    again, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">mail us</a> if you want to help.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How will contributions be licensed?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Everything will be publicly available under the
    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons - Attribution - No Derivatives</a> (CC-BY-ND) license.
    This allows free re-use of the material so long as they cite the original source
    and do <em>not</em> distribute modified copies (except as allowed under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a>).
    This is different from the simpler CC-BY license used in our previous books,
    but given the nature of the material,
    we think it's important to guard against the possibility of distortion and misrepresentation.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How will the book be published?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Electronic versions will be made freely available in common formats (HTML, PDF, EPUB, and MOBI).
    Physical copies will be available from a print-on-demand service.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What about royalties?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    As with previous books,
    all royalties will be donated to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Can I contribute anonymously?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    No.
    We recognize there's a risk of people being harassed for doing work like this,
    but realistically,
    if someone really wants to find out who you are,
    they'll probably be able to.
