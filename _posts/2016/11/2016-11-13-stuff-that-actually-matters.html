<p>
  If you know a little about
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monsters-Education-Technology-Audrey-Watters/dp/1505225051/">the history of educational technology</a>
  and understand how
  <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/2012/05/24/everything-you-need-to-know-about-standardized-testing.html">standardized testing perpetuates the status quo</a>,
  you're more likely to see what's wrong-headed about current approaches to online learning.
  Similarly,
  once you know
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_test#Voting">how literacy tests were used to disenfranchise racial minorities</a>,
  you're less likely to be seduced by the idea that
  <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/the-right-to-vote-should-be-restricted-to-those-with-knowledge">citizens should have to pass an exam in order to vote</a>.
  And if engineers at Facebook knew
  <a href="http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/now/politics/216905-the-lingering-effects-of-nyc-racist-city-planning">how city planners made beaches inaccessible to public transit</a>
  so that the "wrong" people couldn't reach them,
  maybe they would have been less quick to build tools that
  <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race">let advertisers hide certain ads from specific racial groups</a>
  (sorry, "ethnic affinities").
</p>

<p>
  I'm therefore pleased to announce that we are going to follow up
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/">this</a>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/">series</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#vol1">of</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#vol2">crowd</a>-<a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#posa">sourced</a>
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#fh">books</a>
  with one about what everyone in tech ought to know about
  racism, sexism, homophobia, poverty, harassment, privacy,
  and our political, economic, and legal systems.
  Our goal is to create something like
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Future-Presidents-Science-Headlines/dp/0393337111/"><em>Physics for Future Presidents</em></a>,
  but instead of explaining nuclear power to someone who might one day run the country,
  we want to explain voter suppression tactics to someone who might one day be asked to build an online voting platform.

    What are you looking for?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Tutorial essays, each 2000-5000 words long.
    Tell us a bit of history,
    explain why a widely-held belief is wrong,
    or connect the dots so that people don't have to on their own.
    Fred Clark's article on
    <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2016/03/11/this-is-what-abortion-politics-is-for/">abortion politics</a>,
    a more accessible version of Matthew Stoller's <a href="http://mattstoller.tumblr.com/post/76864855963/review-of-capitalizing-on-crisis-by-greta">thoughts on deregulation</a>,
    or an expanded version of <a href="https://twitter.com/SiyandaWrites/status/796286719058382848">Siyanda Mohutsiwa's analysis of how young white men are being radicalized online</a>
    would all teach both useful specifics
    and a way of seeing the world that most programmers have never been exposed to.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What <em>aren't</em> you looking for?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Rants and sermons.
    This book's job is to inform:
    we hope that knowledge will lead to action,
    but our focus is on the first.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Does the material have to be original?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Absolutely not.
    If we can recycle something you have already written, please let us know.
    And if you have seen something that you think we <em>ought</em> to recycle,
    please point us at it:
    we're happy to try to talk people into letting us share their work more widely.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    But isn't all this stuff out there on the Internet already?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Sure,
    but that's like saying that Google and Stack Overflow
    mean that we don't need lessons on programming.
    A lot of people don't know where to look or what to look for,
    so providing some starting points and context can make a big difference.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Do contributions have to be about technology?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    No.
    Our focus is about the world technology acts in and on,
    rather than the technology itself.
    For example,
    our intended readers probably don't need us to explain what Tor is,
    but they probably haven't ever had someone walk them through
    the flaws in the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument">nothing to hide</a>" argument.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Do I need to be in tech to contribute?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Absolutely not.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Why you?  Why now?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Because we've had a lot of experience assembling books this way.
    And if not now, then when?
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How can I get involved?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">Mail us</a> if you'd like to contribute.
    If you know what you want to write about, tell us;
    if you don't, we have lots of topics that need to be covered.
    And don't worry if you're not yet an expert:
    so long as you're willing to learn along the way,
    it may actually make you better at explaining your topic to people starting from the same place as you.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How else can I get involved?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We'll be looking for reviewers as well:
    again, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">mail us</a> if you want to help.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How soon do you want contributions?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A year ago.
    Hell, thirty years ago,
    so that we wouldn't get into the mess we're in now.
    But since we're here now,
    we'd like people to commit by the end of the year,
    and to get us first drafts by the end of February.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How are copyright and licensing being handled?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Authors will retain copyright to their own material.
    Everything will be publicly available under the
    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons - Attribution - No Derivatives</a> (CC-BY-ND) license.
    This allows free re-use of the material so long as they cite the original source
    and do <em>not</em> distribute modified copies (except as allowed under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a>).
    This is different from the simpler CC-BY license used in our previous books,
    but given the nature of the material,
    we think it's important to guard against the possibility of distortion and misrepresentation.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How will the book be published?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Electronic versions will be made freely available in common formats (HTML, PDF, EPUB, and MOBI).
    Physical copies will be available from a print-on-demand service.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What about royalties?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    As with previous books,
    all royalties will be donated to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Can I contribute anonymously?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    No.
    We recognize there's a risk of people being harassed for doing work like this,
    but we believe in the importance of creditable authorship and demonstratably diverse voices
    as a pushback against the devaluation of marginalized perspectives.
    And realistically,
    if someone really wants to find out who you are,
    they'll probably be able to.
