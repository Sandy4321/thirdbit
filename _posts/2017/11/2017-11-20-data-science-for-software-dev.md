[DataCamp][datacamp] has just posted an article I helped co-author
about [using data science to explore software development][dc-post].
If you'd like to see more on the topic,
please comment, tweet, re-post, and share with your friends and colleagues:
if there's enough interest,
we could build a series of online courses to teach developers
how to get, clean up, and analyze data about their work.
