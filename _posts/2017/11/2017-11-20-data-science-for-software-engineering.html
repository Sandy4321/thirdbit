<p>
  We have just posted a short article at <a href="http://datacamp.com">DataCamp</a>
  (where I now work)
  titled
  "<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/data-science-software-engineering">Using Data Science to Explore Software Development</a>".
  We'd be grateful for feedback,
  and doubly grateful if you could help get it some attention:
  the more people who look and comment,
  the sooner we can move ahead with building some online courses
  to teach people how to get, clean, analyze, and make sense of software engineering data.
