  A colleague recently told me about
  <a href="https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-hawaii">a symposium for early career researchers</a>
  taking place in Hawaii later this month.
  Its mission statement says,
  "We are interested in fostering a cohort of data science researchers that will hopefully persist well beyond the bounds of the meeting."
  I expect it will be fun and fruitful for those taking part,
  but take a look at where attendees are coming from:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td>UC Berkeley</td> <td align="right">10</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>New York University</td> <td align="right">8</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>University of Washington</td> <td align="right">7</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>University of Florida</td> <td align="right">3</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>University of Chicago</td> <td align="right">3</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>University of Pennsylvania</td> <td align="right">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</td> <td align="right">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>UC Davis</td> <td align="right">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Stanford University</td> <td align="right">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Princeton University</td> <td align="right">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>North Carolina State University</td> <td align="right">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Carnegie Mellon University</td> <td align="right">2</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>University of Washington </td> <td align="right">1</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>UT Austin</td> <td align="right">1</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
  This is a pretty swanky list of schools:
  only one of them has "State" in its name.
  Are there no equally deserving early career researchers at Howard,
  Florida International,
  Texas Tech,
  or hundreds of other schools?
  And yes,
  I realize that the meeting is for researchers who are
  "...at the three Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments, members of DDD Investigators' labs, and affiliated with...our 'Practices' grants",
  but that just pushes the question back one level.
</p>

<p>
  I wasn't fully conscious of this in 2010,
  but one of my reasons for rebooting Software Carpentry was to democratize scientific computing.
  Knowing how to use a few key tools can save researchers hundreds of hours a year;
  they can then use some of that time to acquire more skills,
  which in turn will save them more time.
  If you never get on this spiral in the first place,
  though,
  you will be left further and further behind by those who do.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly,
  if you aren't invited to the right meetings at the right moment in your career,
  you won't have a chance to make the connections that will get you invited to the next meeting,
  which in turn means you won't be part of conversations about upcoming grant opportunities,
  who's likely to be hiring for what,
  and so on.
  It's a situation that women and minorities in science are all too familiar with:
  lack of access engenders lack of opportunity,
  which in turn leads to existing inequalities perpetuating themselves.
</p>

<p>
  I would therefore like to suggest that organizers of meetings like this adopt a buddy system.
  Each time they give a place to someone from a top-tier research institution,
  they should offer a place to someone from a school not on their list of usual suspects as well.
  I think this will hasten the spread of practices like open science,
  both by bringing the good word to more institutions,
  but also by giving event sponsors insight into how academia's "other 90%" see the world
  and the issues they face.
  Without that,
  I fear we'll find ourselves singing along with Billie Holiday:
</p>

  Them that's got shall have
  <br/>
  Them that's not shall lose...
