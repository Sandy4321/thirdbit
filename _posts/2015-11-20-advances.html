  Alfred North Whitehead once said that
  civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform
  without thinking about them.
  I've recently realized that something similar is true of organizations and email:
  I now only need to respond to forty or fifty of the Software Carpentry-related messages
  that land in my inbox every day,
  rather than all 200 or so,
  because other people are building things,
  reviewing them,
  making decisions,
  and keeping conversations going.
  It's actually quite wonderful.
