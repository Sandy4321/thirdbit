  Edible fish are maturing faster and getting smaller every year
  because we catch and eat the big ones,
  taking their genes out of circulation with extreme prejudice.
  As I was writing up
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/11/miscellaneous-projects.html">this list of projects</a>
  for <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>,
  and revising <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gvwilson/how-to-become-rich-famous-and-popular-while-using-your-programming-skills-to-make-the-world-a-better-place">this talk</a>,
  I started to wonder if that was why so much of what I see in academic journals and coming out of Silicon Valley
  seems so... flat.
  Tech entrepreneurs think that if you have time to polish your slide deck,
  your idea's probably already been monetized by someone else,
  and academics are pushed more forcefully each year to publish early and publish often.
  I know it's not an original thought,
  but maybe by pressuring ideas to mature sooner we're also making them smaller.
  If so,
  maybe we should think about creating some sort of "catch and release" program
  to give new ideas a chance to grow big and strong
  and have big, strong, healthy offspring.
