              <div class="post-content">
                <p>
  There's been a micro-flurry of excitement in the scientific world
  about <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data">GitHub's recent announcement that</a>
  they will now render tabular text files (i.e., CSV and TSV) on their site.
  Coming on the heels of their support for <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github">GeoJSON</a>,
  this is still more evidence that they're serious about becoming
  a platform for working with data.
</p>
<p>
  So why only two cheers?
  Because they're going about it in the wrong way,
  and as a consequence,
  they'll deliver a lot less value than they could,
  a lot later than they could.
</p>
<p>
  To understand why,
  you need to understand how Facebook plugins work
  technically and socially.
  Nobody actually plays Scrabble "on" Facebook;
  instead,
  when you click on the tiles to put down the word "syzygy",
  Facebook sends a packet of information from its server
  to the server that hosts the Scrabble game.
  That server calculates your score and gives you new tiles
  and then produces a chunk of HTML
  that it sends back to Facebook.
  Facebook then inserts that HTML into its own page
  to display to you.
</p>
<p>
  The key thing here&mdash;the thing that fuelled Facebook's explosive growth&mdash;is
  that Facebook doesn't have to write, debug, and maintain the Scrabble program.
  They didn't have to create ZooVille, either,
  or the appointment calendar app my saxophone teacher used to use,
  or anything else.
  Instead,
  Facebook provides a platform that keeps track of users' passwords,
  their connections with each other,
  and (crucially) what plugins they've enabled.
  And <em>this</em> has meant that Facebook's users can take advantage of
  the work of millions of programmers,
  rather than "just" what a few thousand Facebook employees are able to produce.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine what the world would look like if GitHub worked like this.
  Imagine a world in which a grad student with time on her hands
  could have built a CSV display widget
  and offered it to the GitHub community
  two or three years ago.
  Imagine a world in which a research group that had built
  performance prediction tools for scientific software
  could wrap those up as a plugin
  so that people could browser for hotspots in their R code
  as they were doing code reviews.
  Imagine&mdash;
</p>
<p>
  What's that?
  GitHub has an API?
  Why yes,
  that's true,
  and in theory that means people can provide all these services right now.
  The problem,
  though,
  is that if people have to leave one site and go to another
  in order to use your software,
  they won't.
  It's like asking people to go up a single flight of stairs
  in order to collaborate with one another:
  it doesn't seem like a big deal,
  but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Offices-Manager-Buildings-business/dp/0140169121/">it cuts communication by more than 90%</a>.
  And if they have to download and install something,
  well,
  how much fun has <em>that</em> ever been?
</p>
<p>
  Facebook isn't our only guide to how much better life would be
  if GitHub was a platform rather than a closed box.
  In the early 2000s,
  Eclipse was the IDE of choice for millions of programmers.
  A major reason for its popularity was its plugin ecosystem:
  if you had a new code analysis package,
  or a better interface to a web-hosted bug tracker,
  you could offer people just that
  without having to design, build, or test
  all the other things needed to make a tool credible.
  (As a colleague of mine said back then,
  "Eclipse means I never have to figure out how to get stuff to print again.")
</p>
<p>
  Science is huge:
  it encompasses everything in the universe.
  But it's also pretty small:
  there are often only a handful of people who really understand some topic,
  and only a handful more who even know it exists.
  Software companies can't afford to serve that long tail themselves,
  but they <em>can</em> give us the means to help ourselves.
  It does mean giving up a bit of control,
  but it doesn't seem to have hurt Facebook or Eclipse.
  So,
  two cheers once again for GitHub,
  and here's hoping that we'll be able to give them a third cheer soon.
</p>
<p><em>
  For more on this subject, see <a href="http://steverant.pen.io/">Steve Yegge's epic rant about Google+</a>.
  And yes,
  Facebook is a walled garden that profits from selling people's private lives,
  but that doesn't undermine the arguments in favor of platforms.
