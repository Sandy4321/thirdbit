              <h1><a href="/2017/10/16/exercise-types.html">Oct 16, 2017 - What Kinds of Exercises Do You Use to Teach Programming?</a></h1>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>Every mechanic has her favorite screwdrivers, and every good teacher
has different kinds of exercises to check that her students are
actually learning, let them practice their new skills, and keep them
engaged.  Some types of exercise are well known, but others aren’t as
widely used as they should be. <a href="http://datacamp.com">DataCamp</a> (my current
employer) supports some of each type, and I’m keen to find both new
things to try, and new ways to use what we already have.</p>

<p>In order to be considered for inclusion in this article, an exercise
has to be quick for learners to do, and it has to be possible to check
the answer automatically. These requirements rule out some useful
kinds of assessment, but I was surprised by how many remain.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the two types of exercise <a href="http://datacamp.com">DataCamp</a> users
will be most familiar with. The first is a <strong><em>multiple choice
question</em></strong> that presents a question and asks the student to pick the
correct answer from a list.  Doing this might (in fact, should)
require them to do more than just read and remember, and as a previous
post discussed, multiple-choice questions are most effective when
their wrong answers probe for specific misconceptions on the student’s
part.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: You are in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home/repl</code>.  Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> with an appropriate
argument to get a listing of the files in the directory
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/home/repl/seasonal</code>.  Which of the following files is <em>not</em> in
that directory?</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">autumn.csv</code></li>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">fall.csv</code></li>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">spring.csv</code></li>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">winter.csv</code></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The second type of exercise is <strong>write and run</strong>, in which the student
has to write code that produces a specified output. When the code is
submitted, we check its structure and/or output and give feedback.
Write and run exercises can be as simple or as complex as the
instructor wants. For example, it’s often enough with novices to
simply ask them to call a function or method: experienced instructors
often forget how hard it can be to figure out which parameters go
where.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: the matrix M contains data read from a file. Using one
function or method call, create a matrix Z that has the same shape
as M but contains only zeroes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Write and run</strong> exercises help students practice the skills they
most want to learn, but writing good automated checks is hard:
students can find very creative ways to get the right answer, and it’s
demoralizing to give them a false negative.  One way to reduce how
often this occurs is to give them a small test suite they can run
their code against before they submit it (at which point it is run
against a more comprehensive set of tests).  Doing this helps to catch
cases in which students have completely misunderstood the written spec
of the exercise.</p>

<p>To help students realize just how hard it is to write good tests
instructors can get them to do it themselves.  Instead of writing code
that satisfies some specification, they can be asked to write tests to
determine whether a piece of code conforms to a spec.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">monotonic_sum</code> calculates the sum of each
section of a list of numbers in which the values are monotonically
increasing. For example, given the input <code class="highlighter-rouge">[1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 1]</code>, the
output should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">[4, 3, 9, 1]</code>. Write and run unit tests to
determine which of the following bugs the function contains:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Considers every negative number the start of a new sub-sequence.</li>
    <li>Does not include the first value of each sub-sequence in the
sub-sum.</li>
    <li>Does not include the last value of each sub-sequence in the
sub-sum.</li>
    <li>Only re-starts the sum when values decrease rather than fail
to increase.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Fill in the blanks</em></strong> is a refinement of <strong><em>write and run</em></strong> in which
the student is given some starter code and asked to complete it. (In
practice, many <strong>write and run</strong> exercises are actually <strong>fill in the
blanks</strong> because the instructor will provide comments to remind the
students of what steps they should take.) Novices often find <strong>fill in
the blanks</strong> less intimidating than writing all the code from scratch,
and since the instructor has provided most of the answer’s structure,
submissions are much easier to check.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: fill in the blanks so that the code below prints the string
‘hat’.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>text = 'all that it is'
slice = text[____:____]
print(slice)
</code></pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>A <strong><em>Parsons Problem</em></strong> is another kind of exercise that avoids the
“blank screen of terror” problem: the student is given the lines of code
needed to solve a problem, but has to put them in the right order.
Research over the past few years has shown that <strong>Parsons Problems</strong> are
effective because they allow students to concentrate on control flow
(“what order do I do things?”) separately from vocabulary (“what do I
need to do?”). The same research shows that giving the student more
lines than she needs, or asking her to rearrange some lines and add a
few more, makes this kind of problem significantly harder. Our mobile
platform has direct support for <strong>Parsons Problems</strong>, and they can be
emulated (albeit somewhat clumsily) by asking students to rearrange code
in an editor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: rearrange and indent these lines to calculate the sums of the
positive and negative values in a list.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>positive = 0
return negative, positive
if v &gt; 0
else
positive += v
negative = 0
for v in values
negative += v
</code></pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Tracing execution</em></strong> is the inverse of a Parsons Problem: given a few
lines of code, the student has to trace the order in which those lines
are executed. This is an essential debugging skill, and is a good way to
solidify students’ understanding of loops, conditionals, and the
evaluation order of function and method calls. Again, we don’t yet
support this directly, but it can be emulated by having students type in
a list of line labels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: in what order are the labelled lines in this block of code
executed?</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>A)     vals = [-1, 0, 1]
B)     inverse_sum = 0
       try:
           for v in vals:
C)             inverse_sum += 1/v
       except:
D)         pass
</code></pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Tracing values</em></strong> is similar to <strong>tracing execution</strong>, but instead of
spelling out the order in which code is executed, the student is asked
to list the values that one or more variables take on as the program
runs. Again, it can be implemented by having students type in their
answers, but this quickly becomes impractical. In practice, the best
approach is to give the student a table whose columns are labelled with
variable names and whose rows are labelled with line numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: what lines of text pass through the pipes and the final
redirect when this file:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>2017-11-01,Akeratu,9
2017-11-01,Monona,3
2017-11-02,Monona,1
2017-11-03,Monona,1
2017-11-03,Akeratu,7
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>is run through this Unix shell command:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cut -d , -f 2 filename | sort | uniq &gt; result.txt
</code></pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Returning to debugging skills, another exercise that helps student
develop them is <strong><em>minimal fixes</em></strong>. Given a few lines of code that
contain a bug, the student must either make or identify the smallest
change that will produce the correct output. Making the change can be
done as using <strong>write and run</strong>, while identifying it can be done as a
<strong>multiple choice question</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: this function is supposed to test whether a point <code class="highlighter-rouge">(x, y)</code> lies
strictly within a rectangle defined by <code class="highlighter-rouge">(x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)</code>.
Change one line to make it do so correctly.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>def inside(point, rect):
    if (point.x &lt;= rect.x_min): return false
    if (point.y &lt;= rect.y_min): return false
    if (point.x &gt;= rect.y_max): return false
    if (point.y &gt;= rect.y_max): return false
    return true
</code></pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Theme and variation</strong> exercises are similar, but instead of making a
change to fix a bug, the student is asked to make a small alteration
that changes the output in some specific way. These alterations can
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>replacing one function call with another</li>
  <li>changing one variable’s initial value</li>
  <li>swapping an inner and outer loop</li>
  <li>changing the order of tests in a chain of conditionals</li>
  <li>changing the nesting of function calls or the order in which methods
are chained</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this gives students a chance to practice a useful real-world
skill: the fastest way to produce a working program is often to tweak
one that already does something useful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: change the inner loop control in the function below so that
it sets the upper left triangle of the matrix to zero.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>def zeroTriangle(matrix):
    for c in range(matrix.cols):
        for r in range(matrix.rows):
            matrix[r, c] = 0
</code></pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Matching problems are another entire family of exercises. A
<strong><em>one-to-one matching problem</em></strong> gives the student two lists of equal
length and asks her to pair corresponding items, e.g., “match each piece
of code with the output it produces”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: match each function’s name with the operation it implements.</p>

  <table class="table table-striped">
<tr><td>SGEMV</td><td>triangular banded matrix-vector multiply</td></tr>
<tr><td>STBMV</td><td>solve triangular matrix with multiple right-hand sides</td></tr>
<tr><td>STRSM</td><td>matrix-vector multiply</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Many-to-many matching problems</strong> are similar, but the lists aren’t the
same length, so some items may be matched to several others. Both kinds
require students to use higher-order thinking skills, but many-to-many
are more difficult because students can’t do easy matches first to
reduce their search space.</p>

<p>Our platform doesn’t currently support matching problems; they can be
emulated by having students submit lists of pairs as text (such as “A3,
B1, C2”), but that’s clumsy and error-prone. A future implementation
could re-use machinery built for <strong>Parsons Problems</strong> and let students
drag and drop blocks of text to form matches.</p>

<p>Drag-and-drop would open many other doors: for example, <strong>tracing
execution</strong> is easy to implement this way. So is <strong><em>labelling
diagrams</em></strong>: rather than students typing in the labels, it is faster and
more reliable for them to drag labels around to attach to the correct
elements. The picture can be a complex data structure (“after this code
is executed, which variables point to which parts of this structure?”),
the graph that a program produces (“match each of these pieces of code
with the part of the graph it generated”), the code itself (“match each
term to an example of that program element”), or many other things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: label the following diagram to show which structures the
variables <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">z</code> refer to after these three lines of code
are executed.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>x = 3
y = [x, x]
z = [x, y]
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p><img src="/files/2017/10/label.svg" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Drawing diagrams</em></strong> of things like data structures is also
straightforward to do on paper but very difficult to grade
automatically. One way to make solutions gradable may be to constrain
the drawing in the same way that <strong>Parsons Problems</strong> constrain code
construction, i.e., give students the pieces of the diagram and ask them
to arrange them correctly, but this is a long way off.</p>

<p>We mentioned earlier that matching problems require students to use
higher-order thinking skills. <strong><em>Summarization</em></strong> also does this, and
gives them a chance to practice a skill that is very useful when
<em>reporting</em> bugs rather than fixing them. For example, students can be
asked, “Which sentence best describes how the output of f changes as x
varies from 0 to 10?” and then given several options as a <strong>multiple
choice question</strong>. Similarly, <strong><em>ranking problems</em></strong> present the student
with several choices and ask them to order them from fastest to slowest,
most robust to most brittle, and so on. (<strong>Ranking</strong> is more manageable
when implemented with drag and drop than as a <strong>multiple choice
question</strong>.)</p>

<p>One other kind of exercise that can be implemented as a <strong>multiple
choice question</strong> is <strong><em>fault mapping</em></strong>: given a piece of buggy code
and an error message, the student has to identify the line on which the
error occurred. In simple cases this will be the line mentioned in the
error message, but in more subtle cases, the student will have to trace
execution forward and backward to figure out where things first went
wrong.</p>

<p><a href="http://datacamp.com">DataCamp</a>’s platform doesn’t directly support all of these
kinds of exercises yet, and there are others that are hard for any
online platform to provide.  <strong><em>Refactoring exercises</em></strong> are the
complement of <strong>theme and variation</strong> exercises: given a working piece
of code, the student has to modify it in some way <em>without</em> changing
its output. For example, the student could be asked to replace loops
with vectorized expressions, to simplify the condition in a while
loop, etc. The challenge here is that there are often so many ways to
refactor a piece of code that grading requires human intervention.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: write a single list comprehension that has the same effect
as this loop.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>result = []
for v in values:
    if len(v) &gt; threshold:
        result.append(v)
</code></pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Code review</em></strong> is hard to grade automatically in the general case,
but can be tackled if the student is given a rubric (i.e., a list of
faults to look for) and asked to match particular comments against
particular lines of code. For example, the student can be told that
there are two indentation errors and one bad variable name, and asked
to point them out; if she is more advanced, she could be given half a
dozen kinds of remarks she could make about the code without guidance
as to how many of each she should find.  As with <strong>tracing values</strong>,
this is easiest for students to do when presented as a table, which we
currently don’t support.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: using the rubric provided, mark each line of the code below.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>01)  def addem(f):
02)      x1 = open(f).readlines()
03)      x2 = [x for x in x1 if x.strip()]
04)      changes = 0
05)      for v in x2:
06)          print('total', total)
07)          tot = tot + int(v)
08)      print('total')
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <ol>
    <li>poor variable name</li>
    <li>unused variable</li>
    <li>use of undefined variable</li>
    <li>missing values</li>
    <li>fossil code</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>There are undoubtedly many other kinds of exercises out there that are
also fast to do and automatically gradable, but which we haven’t heard
of. If you know of any, we’d enjoy hearing about them.</p>
