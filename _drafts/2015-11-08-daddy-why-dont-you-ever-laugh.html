title: "Daddy, Why Don't You Ever Laugh?"

<p>
  We were eating dinner on Friday night when my daughter asked me,
  "Daddy, why don't you ever laugh?"
  I didn't have an answer.
  I used to laugh&mdash;at least, I think I did&mdash;but she was right:
  it had been a while.
</p>
<p>
  Coincidentally (or perhaps not)
  I had just finished reading
  Jesse Noller's post <a href="http://jessenoller.com/blog/2015/9/27/a-lot-happens">A Lot Happens</a>,
  in which he said:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    You can't be emotionally all in on everything.
    You can't make another 24 hours appear to be "present" for everything...
    I stole time and ran my emotional credit card like it was limitless.
    I stole time from my family, from work, from everything.
    I stole it from me, I gave time, emotion and empathy freely to anything and everyone.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In a <a href="http://jessenoller.com/blog/2015/10/31/community-boundaries">companion piece</a>
  written a month later,
  he showed the price of being "all in" by turning this classic XKCD cartoon:

  into this:

</p>
<p>
  It took a lot of courage to be as honest as Jesse was.
  What follows is my attempt to live up to his example.
</p>
<p>
  I've <a href="{{page.root}}/2011/02/09/lets-talk.html">written before</a>
  about the depression I struggled with in my twenties and thirties.
  At the time (early 2011) it had been eight years since I'd had a bad crash.
  That streak lasted until April of this year,
  when I had a week of panic attacks and insomnia.
  I pulled out of that fairly quickly,
  but had a relapse from late June until early August
  during which I struggled to string three thoughts together.
  I was OK again until this past week,
  when it all went splat for four very bleak days.
</p>
<p>
  The worst part is,
  I did this to myself.
  I left Mozilla last summer to set up Software Carpentry as an independent organization.
  I expected it to be difficult,
  but it turned out to be a lot harder than I'd anticipated&mdash;so much so that
  I wound up running on fumes in November and December.
  Things were so bad at one point that I decided I'd better polish my rusty programming skills,
  just in case things fell apart completely and I had to get a real job.
  The last thing I'd worked on was an e-commerce application written in Django,
  so I started building <a href="http://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/">a forms-based application to manage Software Carpentry workshops</a>.
</p>
<p>
  All of that might have been manageable,
  but while it was going on
  my wife and I decided to sell our house to get away from a toxic neighbor.
  And since we were doing that,
  it seemed only sensible to bring forward our plan to spend a year in England.
  After all,
  if we were going to pack up our stuff for a move anyway,
  why not leave it in storage and go and have an adventure?
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile,
  Gamergate and other things forced me to acknowledge that
  running Software Carpentry workshops for female grad students was pretty small change
  when people were getting death threats.
  I didn't know what else to do,
  so I approached a bunch of people about organizing a <a href="http://t3summit.org">two-day workshop</a>
  for grassroots get-into-tech groups focused on women,
  minorities,
  the physically and mentally challenged,
  people coming out of prison,
  and everyone else who didn't fit the Silicon Valley mold
  in the hopes that they'd tell me.
</p>
<p>
  Each of these things was worth doing,
  but together they were too much.
  As Jesse said,
  you can't be all in on everything.
  All you can do is run dry,
  and I did.
  When we discovered that UK visa rules had changed
  and we'd only be able to spend six months overseas
  instead of the year we'd hoped for,
  I had no reserves left.
  When we had to find a place in England long-distance,
  then pack up a house I once thought I'd live in for the next twenty years,
  then deal with my father's cancer diagnosis,
  I had nothing to fall back on,
  so I crashed.
</p>
<p>
  The sensible response would have been to scale back,
  but I couldn't.
  I mean that literally:
  every time I told myself the world would get along just fine
  if I didn't answer email for a few hours,
  my panic attacks would return.
  I was hooked on being plugged in
  every bit as much as my two-packs-a-day father was hooked on cigarettes,
  and it was every bit as unhealthy.
  And of course when email withdrawal makes me twitchy I start making more mistakes,
  which means more things go wrong,
  which makes me feel it's even more important for me to get online and sort stuff out.
</p>
<p>
  Programmers never used to talk about stuff like this
  (at least, none of the ones I knew did when I was around to hear it),
  but I think it's more important than elevator pitches,
  cache management,
  and functional programming put together.
  Everyone has limits,
  so everyone should know that there's no shame in saying,
  "That's great but I can't."
  There's no shame in deciding that something is worth doing
  but you're not going to do it.
  And there's no shame in saying,
  "I messed this up."
  I think that if more of us did that&mdash;if more of us followed Jesse's lead&mdash;all of us would be better for it.
